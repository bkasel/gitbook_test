<p>Motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, causing us
to marvel at the forces needed to achieve spectacular motion, such as
that of a jumping dolphin, a leaping pole vaulter, a bird in flight, or
an orbiting satellite. The study of motion is kinematics, but kinematics
only <em>describes</em> the way objects move—their velocity and their
acceleration. <span id="import-auto-id2665402" data-type="term">Dynamics</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> considers the forces
that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton’s laws of
motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws provide an example of
the breadth and simplicity of principles under which nature functions.
They are also universal laws in that they apply to situations on Earth
as well as in space.</p>
<p>Isaac Newton’s (1642–1727) laws of motion were just one part of the
monumental work that has made him legendary. The development of Newton’s
laws marks the transition from the Renaissance into the modern era. This
transition was characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people
thought about the physical universe. For many centuries natural
philosophers had debated the nature of the universe based largely on
certain rules of logic, with great weight given to the thoughts of
earlier classical philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BC). Among
the many great thinkers who contributed to this change were Newton and
Galileo Galilei (1564–1647).</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Isaac Newton’s monumental work, <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica</em>, was published in 1687. It proposed scientific laws that
are still used today to describe the motion of objects. (credit: Service

Strasbourg)</p>
</div>
<p>Galileo was instrumental in establishing <em>observation</em> as the absolute
determinant of truth, rather than “logical” argument. Galileo’s use of
the telescope was his most notable achievement in demonstrating the
importance of observation. He discovered moons orbiting Jupiter and made
other observations that were inconsistent with certain ancient ideas and
religious dogma. For this reason, and because of the manner in which he
dealt with those in authority, Galileo was tried by the Inquisition and
punished. He spent the final years of his life under a form of house
arrest. Because others before Galileo had also made discoveries by
<em>observing</em> the nature of the universe and because repeated observations
verified those of Galileo, his work could not be suppressed or denied.
After his death, his work was verified by others, and his ideas were
eventually accepted by the church and scientific communities.</p>
<p>Galileo also contributed to the formulation of what is now called
Newton’s first law of motion. Newton made use of the work of his
predecessors, which enabled him to develop laws of motion, discover the
law of gravity, invent calculus, and make great contributions to the
theories of light and color. It is amazing that many of these
developments were made by Newton working alone, without the benefit of
the usual interactions that take place among scientists today.</p>
<p>Newton’s laws are introduced along with Big Idea 3, that interactions
can be described by forces. These laws provide a theoretical basis for
studying motion depending on interactions between the objects. In
particular, Newton's laws are applicable to all forces in inertial
frames of references (Enduring Understanding 3.A). We will find that all
forces are vectors; that is, forces always have both a magnitude and a
direction (Essential Knowledge 3.A.2). Furthermore, we will learn that
all forces are a result of interactions between two or more objects
(Essential Knowledge 3.A.3). These interactions between any two objects
are described by Newton's third law, stating that the forces exerted on
these objects are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to each
other (Essential Knowledge 3.A.4).</p>
<p>We will discover that there is an empirical cause-effect relationship
between the net force exerted on an object of mass <em>m</em> and its
acceleration, with this relationship described by Newton's second law
(Enduring Understanding 3.B). This supports Big Idea 1, that inertial
mass is a property of an object or a system. The mass of an object or a
system is one of the factors affecting changes in motion when an object
or a system interacts with other objects or systems (Essential Knowledge
1.C.1). Another is the net force on an object, which is the vector sum
of all the forces exerted on the object (Essential Knowledge 3.B.1). To
analyze this, we use free-body diagrams to visualize the forces exerted
on a given object in order to find the net force and analyze the
object's motion (Essential Knowledge 3.B.2).</p>
<p>Thinking of these objects as systems is a concept introduced in this
chapter, where a system is a collection of elements that could be
considered as a single object without any internal structure (Essential
Knowledge 5.A.1). This will support Big Idea 5, that changes that occur
to the system due to interactions are governed by conservation laws.
These conservation laws will be the focus of later chapters in this
book. They explain whether quantities are conserved in the given system
or change due to transfer to or from another system due to interactions
between the systems (Enduring Understanding 5.A).</p>
<p>Furthermore, when a situation involves more than one object, it is
important to define the system and analyze the motion of a whole system,
not its elements, based on analysis of external forces on the system.
This supports Big Idea 4, that interactions between systems cause
changes in those systems. All kinematics variables in this case describe
the motion of the center of mass of the system (Essential Knowledge
4.A.1, Essential Knowledge 4.A.2). The internal forces between the
elements of the system do not affect the velocity of the center of mass
(Essential Knowledge 4.A.3). The velocity of the center of mass will
change only if there is a net external force exerted on the system
(Enduring Understanding 4.A).</p>
<p>We will learn that some of these interactions can be explained by the
existence of fields extending through space, supporting Big Idea 2. For
example, any object that has mass creates a gravitational field in space
(Enduring Understanding 2.B). Any material object (one that has mass)
placed in the gravitational field will experience gravitational force
(Essential Knowledge 2.B.1).</p>
<p>Forces may be categorized as contact or long-distance (Enduring
Understanding 3.C). In this chapter we will work with both. An example
of a long-distance force is gravitation (Essential Knowledge 3.C.1).
Contact forces, such as tension, friction, normal force, and the force
of a spring, result from interatomic electric forces at the microscopic
level (Essential Knowledge 3.C.4).</p>
<p>It was not until the advent of modern physics early in the twentieth
century that it was discovered that Newton’s laws of motion produce a
good approximation to motion only when the objects are moving at speeds
much, much less than the speed of light and when those objects are
larger than the size of most molecules (about 10<sup>–9</sup> m in diameter).
These constraints define the realm of classical mechanics, as discussed
in <a href="/m54763">Introduction to the Nature of Science and Physics</a>. At the
beginning of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein (1879–1955)
developed the theory of relativity and, along with many other
scientists, quantum theory. Quantum theory does not have the constraints
present in classical physics. All of the situations we consider in this
chapter, and all those preceding the introduction of relativity in
<strong>Special Relativity</strong>, are in the realm of classical physics.</p>
<p>The development of special relativity and empirical observations at
atomic scales led to the idea that there are four basic forces that
account for all known phenomena. These forces are called fundamental
(Enduring Understanding 3.G). The properties of gravitational (Essential
Knowledge 3.G.1) and electromagnetic (Essential Knowledge 3.G.2) forces
are explained in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Big Idea 1</strong> Objects and systems have properties such as mass and
charge. Systems may have internal structure.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 1.C.1 Inertial mass is the property of an object or
a system that determines how its motion changes when it interacts with
other objects or systems.</p>
<p><strong>Big Idea 2</strong> Fields existing in space can be used to explain
interactions.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 2.A A field associates a value of some physical
quantity with every point in space. Field models are useful for
describing interactions that occur at a distance (long-range forces) as
well as a variety of other physical phenomena.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 2.A.1 A vector field gives, as a function of
position (and perhaps time), the value of a physical quantity that is
described by a vector.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 2.A.2 A scalar field gives the value of a physical
quantity.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 2.B A gravitational field is caused by an object
with mass.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 2.B.1 A gravitational field <em>g</em> at the location of
an object with mass <em>m</em> causes a gravitational force of magnitude <em>mg</em>
to be exerted on the object in the direction of the field.</p>
<p><strong>Big Idea 3</strong> The interactions of an object with other objects can be
described by forces.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.A All forces share certain common
characteristics when considered by observers in inertial reference
frames.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.A.2 Forces are described by vectors.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.A.3 A force exerted on an object is always due to
the interaction of that object with another object.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.A.4 If one object exerts a force on a second
object, the second object always exerts a force of equal magnitude on
the first object in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.B Classically, the acceleration of an object
interacting with other objects can be predicted by using
<span class="math inline">\(a = {\sum{F/m}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.B.1 If an object of interest interacts with
several other objects, the net force is the vector sum of the individual
forces.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.B.2 Free-body diagrams are useful tools for
visualizing the forces being exerted on a single object and writing the
equations that represent a physical situation.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.C At the macroscopic level, forces can be
categorized as either long-range (action-at-a-distance) forces or
contact forces.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.C.1 Gravitational force describes the interaction
of one object that has mass with another object that has mass.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.C.4 Contact forces result from the interaction of
one object touching another object, and they arise from interatomic
electric forces. These forces include tension, friction, normal, spring
(Physics 1), and buoyant (Physics 2).</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.G Certain types of forces are considered
fundamental.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.G.1 Gravitational forces are exerted at all scales
and dominate at the largest distance and mass scales.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.G.2 Electromagnetic forces are exerted at all
scales and can dominate at the human scale.</p>
<p><strong>Big Idea 4</strong> Interactions between systems can result in changes in
those systems.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 4.A The acceleration of the center of mass of a
system is related to the net force exerted on the system, where
<span class="math inline">\(a = {\sum{F/m}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 4.A.1 The linear motion of a system can be described
by the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of its center of mass.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 4.A.2 The acceleration is equal to the rate of
change of velocity with time, and velocity is equal to the rate of
change of position with time.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 4.A.3 Forces that systems exert on each other are
due to interactions between objects in the systems. If the interacting
objects are parts of the same system, there will be no change in the
center-of-mass velocity of that system.</p>
<p><strong>Big Idea 5</strong> Changes that occur as a result of interactions are
constrained by conservation laws.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 5.A Certain quantities are conserved, in the
sense that the changes of those quantities in a given system are always
equal to the transfer of that quantity to or from the system by all
possible interactions with other systems.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 5.A.1 A system is an object or a collection of
objects. The objects are treated as having no internal structure.</p>

</div>
<p><span id="import-auto-id2134480" data-type="term">Dynamics</span> is the study of the
forces that cause objects and systems to move. To understand this, we
need a working definition of force. Our intuitive definition of
<span id="import-auto-id2712510" data-type="term">force</span>—that is, a push or a
pull—is a good place to start. We know that a push or pull has both
magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity) and can
vary considerably in each regard. For example, a cannon exerts a strong
force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth
exerts only a tiny downward pull on a flea. Our everyday experiences
also give us a good idea of how multiple forces add. If two people push
in different directions on a third person, as illustrated in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2379809" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, we might expect
the total force to be in the direction shown. Since force is a vector,
it adds just like other vectors, as illustrated in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2379809" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a) for two ice
skaters. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can
be added using the familiar head-to-tail method or by trigonometric
methods. These ideas were developed in <a href="/m54779">Two-Dimensional
Kinematics</a>.</p>
<p>By definition, force is always the result of an interaction of two or
more objects. No object possesses force on its own. For example, a
cannon does not possess force, but it can exert force on a cannonball.
Earth does not possess force on its own, but exerts force on a football
or on any other massive object. The skaters in <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2379809">Figure
4.3</a> exert force on one another as they
interact.</p>
<p>No object can exert force on itself. When you clap your hands, one hand
exerts force on the other. When a train accelerates, it exerts force on
the track and vice versa. A bowling ball is accelerated by the hand
throwing it; once the hand is no longer in contact with the bowling
ball, it is no longer accelerating the bowling ball or exerting force on
it. The ball continues moving forward due to inertia.</p>

<p class="caption">Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third.
Forces are vectors and add like other vectors, so the total force on the
third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body
diagram representing the forces acting on the third
skater.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2379809" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(b) is our first
example of a <span id="import-auto-id1590568" data-type="term">free-body diagram</span>, which is a technique used to illustrate all the
<span id="import-auto-id1608860" data-type="term">external forces</span> acting on a
body. The body is represented by a single isolated point (or free body),
and only those forces acting <em>on</em> the body from the outside (external
forces) are shown. (These forces are the only ones shown, because only
external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any
internal forces within the body.) Free-body diagrams are very useful in
analyzing forces acting on a system and are employed extensively in the
study and application of Newton’s laws of motion.</p>
<p>A more quantitative definition of force can be based on some standard
force, just as distance is measured in units relative to a standard
distance. One possibility is to stretch a spring a certain fixed
distance, as illustrated in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2608835" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, and use the
force it exerts to pull itself back to its relaxed shape—called a
<em>restoring force</em>—as a standard. The magnitude of all other forces can
be stated as multiples of this standard unit of force. Many other
possibilities exist for standard forces. (One that we will encounter in
<a href="/m55373">Magnetism</a> is the magnetic force between two wires carrying
electric current.) Some alternative definitions of force will be given
later in this chapter.</p>

along the track are spaced <em>d</em>/4 apart. Two people drive cars
counterclockwise around the track, as shown. Car <em>X</em> goes around the

<p>Car <em>X</em> is shown on the left, and Car <em>Y</em> is shown on the right.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>Car <em>X</em> takes longer to accelerate and does not spend any time traveling
at top speed. Car <em>Y</em> accelerates over a shorter time and spends time
going at top speed. So Car <em>Y</em> must cover the straightaways in a shorter
time. Curves take the same time, so Car <em>Y</em> must overall take a shorter
time.</p>
<p>ii.</p>
<p>The only difference in the calculations for the time of one segment of
linear acceleration is the difference in distances. That shows that Car
<em>X</em> takes longer to accelerate. The equation <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{4v_{c}} = t_{c}\)</span>
corresponds to Car <em>Y</em> traveling for a time at top speed.</p>
<p>Substituting <span class="math inline">\(a = \frac{v_{c}}{t_{1}}\)</span> into the displacement equation in
part (b) ii gives <span class="math inline">\(D = \frac{3}{2}v_{c}t_{1}\)</span>. This shows that a car
takes less time to reach its maximum speed when it accelerates over a
shorter distance. Therefore, Car <em>Y</em> reaches its maximum speed more
quickly, and spends more time at its maximum speed than Car <em>X</em> does, as
argued in part (b) i.</p>

<ul>
<li>Define mass and inertia.</li>
<li>Understand Newton's first law of motion.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Experience suggests that an object at rest will remain at rest if left
alone, and that an object in motion tends to slow down and stop unless
some effort is made to keep it moving. What <span id="import-auto-id1777407" data-type="term">Newton’s first law of
motion</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> states, however, is
the following:</p>
<div id="fs-id2690663" class="note" data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label="">
<div data-type="title">
<p>Newton’s First Law of Motion</p>
</div>
<p>There exists an inertial frame of reference such that a body at rest
remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant
velocity unless acted on by a net external force.</p>
</div>
<p>Note the repeated use of the verb “remains.” We can think of this law as
preserving the status quo of motion.</p>
<p>The first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one frame
of reference which we call an inertial reference frame, relative to
which the motion of an object not subject to forces is a straight line
at a constant speed. An inertial reference frame is any reference frame
that is not itself accelerating. A car traveling at constant velocity is
an inertial reference frame. A car slowing down for a stoplight, or
speeding up after the light turns green, will be accelerating and is not
an inertial reference frame. Finally, when the car goes around a turn,
which is due to an acceleration changing the direction of the velocity
vector, it is not an inertial reference frame. Note that Newton’s laws
of motion are only valid for inertial reference frames.</p>
<p>Rather than contradicting our experience, <span data-type="term">Newton’s first law of
motion</span> states that there must be a <em>cause</em> (which is
a net external force) <em>for there to be any change in velocity (either a
change in magnitude or direction)</em> in an inertial reference frame. We
will define <em>net external force</em> in the next section. An object sliding
across a table or floor slows down due to the net force of friction
acting on the object. If friction disappeared, would the object still
slow down?</p>
<p>The idea of cause and effect is crucial in accurately describing what
happens in various situations. For example, consider what happens to an
object sliding along a rough horizontal surface. The object quickly
grinds to a halt. If we spray the surface with talcum powder to make the
surface smoother, the object slides farther. If we make the surface even
smoother by rubbing lubricating oil on it, the object slides farther
yet. Extrapolating to a frictionless surface, we can imagine the object
sliding in a straight line indefinitely. Friction is thus the <em>cause</em>
<em><!-- no-selfclose --></em>of the slowing (consistent with Newton’s
first law). The object would not slow down at all if friction were
completely eliminated. Consider an air hockey table. When the air is
turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows
it to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it creates a nearly
frictionless surface, and the puck glides long distances without slowing
down. Additionally, if we know enough about the friction, we can
accurately predict how quickly the object will slow down. Friction is an
external force.</p>
<p>Newton’s first law is completely general and can be applied to anything
from an object sliding on a table to a satellite in orbit to blood
pumped from the heart. Experiments have thoroughly verified that any
change in velocity (speed or direction) must be caused by an external
force. The idea of <em>generally applicable or universal laws</em> is important
not only here—it is a basic feature of all laws of physics.
Identifying these laws is like recognizing patterns in nature from which
further patterns can be discovered. The genius of Galileo, who first
developed the idea for the first law, and Newton, who clarified it, was
to ask the fundamental question, “What is the cause?” Thinking in terms
of cause and effect is a worldview fundamentally different from the
typical ancient Greek approach when questions such as “Why does a tiger
have stripes?” would have been answered in Aristotelian fashion, “That
is the nature of the beast.” True perhaps, but not a useful insight.</p>

<div id="mass" class="section level3" number="4.3.2" data-type="title">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Mass</h3>
<p>The property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with
constant velocity is called <span id="import-auto-id2134480" data-type="term">inertia</span>. Newton’s first law is often called the <span id="import-auto-id1408275" data-type="term">law of
inertia</span>. As we know from
experience, some objects have more inertia than others. It is obviously
more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a
basketball, for example. The inertia of an object is measured by its
<span id="import-auto-id1500464" data-type="term">mass</span>.</p>
<p>An object with a small mass will exhibit less inertia and be more
affected by other objects. An object with a large mass will exhibit
greater inertia and be less affected by other objects. This inertial
mass of an object is a measure of how difficult it is to alter the
uniform motion of the object by an external force.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, mass is a measure of the amount of “stuff” (or matter)
in something. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is
determined by the numbers of atoms and molecules of various types it
contains. Unlike weight, mass does not vary with location. The mass of
an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon.
In practice, it is very difficult to count and identify all of the atoms
and molecules in an object, so masses are not often determined in this
manner. Operationally, the masses of objects are determined by
comparison with the standard kilogram.</p>

<p><span id="import-auto-id765465" data-type="term">Newton’s second law of motion</span>
is closely related to Newton’s first law of motion. It mathematically
states the cause and effect relationship between force and changes in
motion. Newton’s second law of motion is more quantitative and is used
extensively to calculate what happens in situations involving a force.
Before we can write down Newton’s second law as a simple equation giving
the exact relationship of force, mass, and acceleration, we need to
sharpen some ideas that have already been mentioned.</p>
<p>First, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a
change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity. A change in
velocity means, by definition, that there is an
<span id="import-auto-id3190786" data-type="term">acceleration</span>. Newton’s first
law says that a net external force causes a change in motion; thus, we
see that a <em>net external force causes acceleration</em>.</p>
<p>Another question immediately arises. What do we mean by an external
force? An intuitive notion of external is correct—an <span id="import-auto-id3026856" data-type="term">external
force</span> acts from outside the
<span data-type="term">system</span> of interest. For example, in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1993910" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a) the system of
interest is the wagon plus the child in it. The two forces exerted by
the other children are external forces. An internal force acts between
elements of the system. Again looking at
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1993910" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a), the force the
child in the wagon exerts to hang onto the wagon is an internal force
between elements of the system of interest. Only external forces affect
the motion of a system, according to Newton’s first law. (The internal
forces actually cancel, as we shall see in the next section.) <em>You must
define the boundaries of the system before you can determine which
forces are external</em>. Sometimes the system is obvious, whereas other
times identifying the boundaries of a system is more subtle. The concept
of a system is fundamental to many areas of physics, as is the correct
application of Newton’s laws. This concept will be revisited many times
on our journey through physics.</p>
<p>When we describe the acceleration of a system, we are modeling the
system as a single point which contains all of the mass of that system.
The point we choose for this is the point about which the system’s mass
is evenly distributed. For example, in a rigid object, this center of
mass is the point where the object will stay balanced even if only
supported at this point. For a sphere or disk made of homogenous
material, this point is of course at the center. Similarly, for a rod
made of homogenous material, the center of mass will be at the midpoint.</p>
<p>For the rider in the wagon in <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1993910">Figure 4.5</a>, the
center of mass is probably between the rider’s hips. Due to internal
forces, the rider’s hand or hair may accelerate slightly differently,
but it is the acceleration of the system’s center of mass that interests
us. This is true whether the system is a vehicle carrying passengers, a
bowl of grapes, or a planet. When we draw a free-body diagram of a
system, we represent the system’s center of mass with a single point and
use vectors to indicate the forces exerted on that center of mass. (See
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1993910">Figure 4.5</a>.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure%2004_03_01.jpg" id="import-auto-id1993910" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Different forces exerted on the same mass produce different
accelerations. (a) Two children push a wagon with a child in it. Arrows
representing all external forces are shown. The system of interest is
the wagon and its rider. The weight <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span> of the system and the
support of the ground <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span> are also shown for completeness and
are assumed to cancel. The vector <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{f}{}\)</span> represents the friction
acting on the wagon, and it acts to the left, opposing the motion of the
wagon. (b) All of the external forces acting on the system add together
to produce a net force, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{net}}{}\)</span>. The free-body
diagram shows all of the forces acting on the system of interest. The
dot represents the center of mass of the system. Each force vector
extends from this dot. Because there are two forces acting to the right,
we draw the vectors collinearly. (c) A larger net external force
produces a larger acceleration (<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{a&#39;} &gt; \textbf{a}\)</span>) when an
adult pushes the
child.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, it seems reasonable that acceleration should be directly
proportional to and in the same direction as the net (total) external
force acting on a system. This assumption has been verified
experimentally and is illustrated in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1993910" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. In part (a), a
smaller force causes a smaller acceleration than the larger force
illustrated in part (c). For completeness, the vertical forces are also
shown; they are assumed to cancel since there is no acceleration in the
vertical direction. The vertical forces are the weight <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span>
and the support of the ground <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span>, and the horizontal force
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{f}{}\)</span> represents the force of friction. These will be discussed
in more detail in later sections. For now, we will define
<span id="import-auto-id2639388" data-type="term">friction</span> as a force that
opposes the motion past each other of objects that are touching.
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1993910" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(b) shows how
vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net
force, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{net}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To obtain an equation for Newton’s second law, we first write the
relationship of acceleration and net external force as the
proportionality</p>
<div id="eip-id1450972" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{\textbf{a}{\propto}\textbf{F}_{\text{net}},}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\propto\)</span> means “proportional to,” and
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{net}}{}\)</span> is the <span id="import-auto-id1890102" data-type="term">net external
force</span>. (The net external force
is the vector sum of all external forces and can be determined
graphically, using the head-to-tail method, or analytically, using
components. The techniques are the same as for the addition of other
vectors, and are covered in <a href="/m54779">Two-Dimensional Kinematics</a>.) This
proportionality states what we have said in words—<em>acceleration is
directly proportional to the net external force</em>. Once the system of
interest is chosen, it is important to identify the external forces and
ignore the internal ones. It is a tremendous simplification not to have
to consider the numerous internal forces acting between objects within
the system, such as muscular forces within the child’s body, let alone
the myriad of forces between atoms in the objects, but by doing so, we
can easily solve some very complex problems with only minimal error due
to our simplification</p>
<p>Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely
proportional to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the
mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given
force. And indeed, as illustrated in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1375143" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, the same net
external force applied to a car produces a much smaller acceleration
than when applied to a basketball. The proportionality is written as</p>
<div id="eip-id1969451" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{\textbf{a}{\propto}\frac{1}{m}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em> is the mass of the system.
Experiments have shown that acceleration is exactly inversely
proportional to mass, just as it is exactly linearly proportional to the
net external force.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure%2004_03_02.jpg" id="import-auto-id1375143" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The same force exerted on systems of different masses produces
different accelerations. (a) A basketball player pushes on a basketball
to make a pass. (The effect of gravity on the ball is ignored.) (b) The
same player exerts an identical force on a stalled SUV and produces a
far smaller acceleration (even if friction is negligible). (c) The
free-body diagrams are identical, permitting direct comparison of the
two situations. A series of patterns for the free-body diagram will
emerge as you do more
problems.</p>
</div>
<p>Both of these proportionalities have been experimentally verified
repeatedly and consistently, for a broad range of systems and scales.
Thus, it has been <strong>experimentally</strong> found that the acceleration of an
object depends <em>only</em> on the net external force and the mass of the
object. Combining the two proportionalities just given yields Newton's
second law of motion.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Weight and the Gravitational Force</h3>
<p>When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth.
Newton’s second law states that a net force on an object is responsible
for its acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on
a falling object is the gravitational force, commonly called its
<span id="import-auto-id3064229" data-type="term">weight</span> <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span>. Weight
can be denoted as a vector <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span> because it has a direction;
<em>down</em> is, by definition, the direction of gravity, and hence weight is
a downward force. The magnitude of weight is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(w{}\)</span><em>.</em> Galileo
was instrumental in showing that, in the absence of air resistance, all
objects fall with the same acceleration <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>. Using Galileo’s result
and Newton’s second law, we can derive an equation for weight.</p>
<p>Consider an object with mass <span class="math inline">\(m{}\)</span> falling downward toward Earth. It
experiences only the downward force of gravity, which has magnitude
<span class="math inline">\(w{}\)</span>. Newton’s second law states that the magnitude of the net external
force on an object is <span class="math inline">\({F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the object experiences only the downward force of gravity,
<span class="math inline">\({F_{\text{net}} = w}{}\)</span>. We know that the acceleration of an object due

second law gives</p>

<p>Weight</p>

<p>This is the equation for <em>weight</em>—the gravitational force on a mass
<span class="math inline">\(m{}\)</span>:</p>
<div id="eip-id1171442268322" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{w = \text{mg}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\({{g =}9.80\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> on Earth, the weight of a 1.0 kg

<p><span class="math display">\[{{{w = \text{mg}} = (}1\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(9.80\ \text{m/s}^{2}{) = 9.8}\ \text{N}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Recall that <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span> can take a positive or negative value, depending on
the positive direction in the coordinate system. Be sure to take this
into consideration when solving problems with weight.</p>
</div>
<p>When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it
is in <span id="import-auto-id1999571" data-type="term">free-fall</span>. That is, the
only force acting on the object is the force of gravity. In the real
world, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in
free-fall because there is always some upward force from the air acting
on the object.</p>
<p>The acceleration due to gravity <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em>
varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so that the weight of an
object depends on location and is not an intrinsic property of the
object. Weight varies dramatically if one leaves Earth’s surface. On the
Moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only
<span class="math inline">\({1.67\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>. A 1.0-kg mass thus has a weight of 9.8 N on
Earth and only about 1.7 N on the Moon.</p>
<p>The broadest definition of weight in this sense is that <em>the weight of
an object is the gravitational force on it from the nearest large body</em>,
such as Earth, the Moon, the Sun, and so on. This is the most common and
useful definition of weight in physics. It differs dramatically,
however, from the definition of weight used by NASA and the popular
media in relation to space travel and exploration. When they speak of
“weightlessness” and “microgravity,” they are really referring to the
phenomenon we call “free-fall” in physics. We shall use the above
definition of weight, and we will make careful distinctions between
free-fall and actual weightlessness.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware that weight and mass are very different
physical quantities, although they are closely related. Mass is the
quantity of matter (how much “stuff”) and does not vary in classical
physics, whereas weight is the gravitational force and does vary
depending on gravity. It is tempting to equate the two, since most of
our examples take place on Earth, where the weight of an object only
varies a little with the location of the object. Furthermore, the terms
<em>mass</em> and <em>weight</em> are used interchangeably in everyday language; for
example, our medical records often show our “weight” in kilograms, but
never in the correct units of newtons.</p>

<div data-type="title">
<p>Common Misconceptions: Mass vs. Weight</p>
</div>
<p>Mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language.
However, in science, these terms are distinctly different from one
another. Mass is a measure of how much matter is in an object. The
typical measure of mass is the kilogram (or the “slug” in English
units). Weight, on the other hand, is a measure of the force of gravity
acting on an object. Weight is equal to the mass of an object (<span class="math inline">\(m{}\)</span>)
multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (<span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>). Like any other
force, weight is measured in terms of newtons (or pounds in English
units).</p>
<p>Assuming the mass of an object is kept intact, it will remain the same,
regardless of its location. However, because weight depends on the
acceleration due to gravity, the weight of an object <em>can change</em> when
the object enters into a region with stronger or weaker gravity. For
example, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is
<span class="math inline">\({1.67\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> (which is much less than the acceleration due
to gravity on Earth, <span class="math inline">\({9.80\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>). If you measured your
weight on Earth and then measured your weight on the Moon, you would
find that you “weigh” much less, even though you do not look any
skinnier. This is because the force of gravity is weaker on the Moon. In
fact, when people say that they are “losing weight,” they really mean
that they are losing “mass” (which in turn causes them to weigh less).</p>

<p>The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as that of the
net force, which is parallel to the ground. There is no information
given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the
system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For
example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be
greater than the friction opposing the motion (since we know the mower
moves forward), and the vertical forces must cancel if there is to be no
acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only
horizontally). The acceleration found is small enough to be reasonable
for a person pushing a mower. Such an effort would not last too long
because the person’s top speed would soon be reached.</p>

<p>What Rocket Thrust Accelerates This Sled?</p>

<p>Prior to manned space flights, rocket sleds were used to test aircraft,

<p>Although there are forces acting vertically and horizontally, we assume
the vertical forces cancel since there is no vertical acceleration. This
leaves us with only horizontal forces and a simpler one-dimensional
problem. Directions are indicated with plus or minus signs, with right
taken as the positive direction. See the free-body diagram in the

<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution</span></p>
</div>
<p>Since acceleration, mass, and the force of friction are given, we start
with Newton’s second law and look for ways to find the thrust of the
engines. Since we have defined the direction of the force and
acceleration as acting “to the right,” we need to consider only the
magnitudes of these quantities in the calculations. Hence we begin with</p>
<div id="eip-id2420800" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}},\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{net}}{}\)</span> is the net force along the horizontal
direction. We can see from <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#fs-id2407992" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>
that the engine thrusts add, while friction opposes the thrust. In
equation form, the net external force is</p>
<div id="eip-id1522873" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}} = {4T - f}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Substituting this into Newton’s second law gives</p>
<div id="eip-id1858333" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}} = {4T - f}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Using a little algebra, we solve for the total thrust 4<em>T</em>:</p>
<div id="eip-id1948969" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{4T = {\text{ma} + f}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Substituting known values yields</p>
<div id="eip-id2054706" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{4T = {\text{ma} + f}} = (}\text{2100\ kg})(\text{49\ m/s}^{2}{) + \text{650\ N}}}.\]</span></p>

<p>So the total thrust is</p>

<p>The numbers are quite large, so the result might surprise you.
Experiments such as this were performed in the early 1960s to test the
limits of human endurance and the setup designed to protect human
subjects in jet fighter emergency ejections. Speeds of 1000 km/h were
obtained, with accelerations of 45 <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>'s. (Recall that <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>, the
acceleration due to gravity, is <span class="math inline">\({9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>. When
we say that an acceleration is 45 <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>'s, it is
<span class="math inline">\({\text{45}\times 9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>, which is
approximately <span class="math inline">\(\text{440\ m/s}^{2}{}\)</span>.) While living subjects are not
used any more, land speeds of 10,000 km/h have been obtained with rocket
sleds. In this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest
is obvious. We will see in later examples that choosing the system of
interest is crucial—and the choice is not always obvious.</p>
<p>Newton’s second law of motion is more than a definition; it is a
relationship among acceleration, force, and mass. It can help us make
predictions. Each of those physical quantities can be defined
independently, so the second law tells us something basic and universal
about nature. The next section introduces the third and final law of
motion.</p>

<p>There is a passage in the musical <em>Man of la
Mancha<!-- no-selfclose --></em> that relates to Newton’s third law
of motion. Sancho, in describing a fight with his wife to Don Quixote,
says, “Of course I hit her back, Your Grace, but she’s a lot harder than
me and you know what they say, ‘Whether the stone hits the pitcher or
the pitcher hits the stone, it’s going to be bad for the pitcher.’” This
is exactly what happens whenever one body exerts a force on
another—the first also experiences a force (equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction). Numerous common experiences, such as stubbing a
toe or throwing a ball, confirm this. It is precisely stated in
<span id="import-auto-id1260844" data-type="term">Newton’s third law of motion</span>.</p>
<div id="fs-id2688761" class="note" data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label="">
<div data-type="title">
<p>Newton’s Third Law of Motion</p>
</div>
<p>Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body
experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
to the force that it exerts.</p>
</div>
<p>This law represents a certain <em>symmetry in nature</em>: Forces always occur
in pairs, and one body cannot exert a force on another without
experiencing a force itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as
“action-reaction,” where the force exerted is the action and the force
experienced as a consequence is the reaction. Newton’s third law has
practical uses in analyzing the origin of forces and understanding which
forces are external to a system.</p>
<p>We can readily see Newton’s third law at work by taking a look at how
people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a
pool, as illustrated in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2338100" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. She pushes
against the pool wall with her feet and accelerates in the direction
<em>opposite</em> to that of her push. The wall has exerted an equal and
opposite force back on the swimmer. You might think that two equal and
opposite forces would cancel, but they do not <em>because they act on
different systems</em>. In this case, there are two systems that we could
investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we select the swimmer to be the
system of interest, as in the figure, then
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}\)</span> is an external force on this
system and affects its motion. The swimmer moves in the direction of
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}\)</span>. In contrast, the force
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}\)</span> acts on the wall and not on our
system of interest. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}\)</span> does not
directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}\)</span>. Note that the swimmer pushes in
the direction opposite to that in which she wishes to move. The reaction
to her push is thus in the desired direction.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_04_04_01.jpg" id="import-auto-id2338100" alt="" />
<p class="caption">When the swimmer exerts a force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}\)</span>
on the wall, she accelerates in the direction opposite to that of her
push. This means the net external force on her is in the direction
opposite to <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}\)</span>. This opposition
occurs because, in accordance with Newton’s third law of motion, the
wall exerts a force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}\)</span> on her, equal
in magnitude but in the direction opposite to the one she exerts on it.
The line around the swimmer indicates the system of interest. Note that
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}\)</span> does not act on this system (the
swimmer) and, thus, does not cancel
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}\)</span>. Thus the free-body diagram shows
only <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span>, the
gravitational force, and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{BF}{}\)</span>, the buoyant force of the water
supporting the swimmer’s weight. The vertical forces <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{BF}{}\)</span> cancel since there is no vertical
motion.</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, when a person stands on Earth, the Earth exerts a force on
the person, pulling the person toward the Earth. As stated by Newton’s
third law of motion, the person also exerts a force that is equal in
magnitude, but opposite in direction, pulling the Earth up toward the
person. Since the mass of the Earth is so great, however, and <span class="math inline">\(F = ma\)</span>,
the acceleration of the Earth toward the person is not noticeable.</p>
<p>Other examples of Newton’s third law are easy to find. As a professor
paces in front of a whiteboard, she exerts a force backward on the
floor. The floor exerts a reaction force forward on the professor that
causes her to accelerate forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because
the ground pushes forward on the drive wheels in reaction to the drive
wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the
wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks
backward. In another example, rockets move forward by expelling gas
backward at high velocity. This means the rocket exerts a large backward
force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber, and the gas therefore
exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket. This reaction force
is called <span id="import-auto-id1295864" data-type="term">thrust</span>. It is a
common misconception that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the
ground or on the air behind them. They actually work better in a vacuum,
where they can more readily expel the exhaust gases. Helicopters
similarly create lift by pushing air down, thereby experiencing an
upward reaction force. Birds and airplanes also fly by exerting force on
air in a direction opposite to that of whatever force they need. For
example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward in order to
get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself in the water by
ejecting water through a funnel from its body, similar to a jet ski. In
a situation similar to Sancho’s, professional cage fighters experience
reaction forces when they punch, sometimes breaking their hand by
hitting an opponent’s body.</p>

<p>Getting Up To Speed: Choosing the Correct System</p>

<p>A physics professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment to a

N on the floor. All forces opposing the motion, such as friction on the
cart’s wheels and air resistance, total 24.0 N.</p>

<p class="caption">A professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment. The lengths of
the arrows are proportional to the magnitudes of the forces (except for
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{f}{}\)</span>, since it is too small to draw to scale). Different
questions are asked in each example; thus, the system of interest must
be defined differently for each. System 1 is appropriate for this
example, since it asks for the acceleration of the entire group of
objects. Only <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{floor}}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{f}{}\)</span> are
external forces acting on System 1 along the line of motion. All other

<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}\)</span> will be an external force and enter into
Newton’s second law. Note that the free-body diagrams, which allow us to
apply Newton’s second law, vary with the system
chosen.</p>
</div>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Strategy</span></p>
</div>
<p>Since they accelerate as a unit, we define the system to be the
professor, cart, and equipment. This is System 1 in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2324690" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. The professor
pushes backward with a force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{foot}}{}\)</span> of 150 N.
According to Newton’s third law, the floor exerts a forward reaction
force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{floor}}{}\)</span> of 150 N on System 1. Because all
motion is horizontal, we can assume there is no net force in the
vertical direction. The problem is therefore one-dimensional along the
horizontal direction. As noted, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{f}{}\)</span> opposes the motion and is
thus in the opposite direction of
<em><!-- no-selfclose --></em><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{floor}}{}\)</span>. Note that
we do not include the forces <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{cart}}{}\)</span> because these are internal forces, and we
do not include <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{foot}}{}\)</span> because it acts on the
floor, not on the system. There are no other significant forces acting
on System 1. If the net external force can be found from all this
information, we can use Newton’s second law to find the acceleration as
requested. See the free-body diagram in the figure.</p>

<p>None of the forces between components of System 1, such as between the
professor’s hands and the cart, contribute to the net external force
because they are internal to System 1. Another way to look at this is to
note that forces between components of a system cancel because they are
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, the force
exerted by the professor on the cart results in an equal and opposite
force back on her. In this case both forces act on the same system and,
therefore, cancel. Thus internal forces (between components of a system)
cancel. Choosing System 1 was crucial to solving this problem.</p>

<p>If we now define the system of interest to be the cart plus equipment

then the net external force on System 2 is the force the professor
exerts on the cart minus friction. The force she exerts on the cart,
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}\)</span>, is an external force acting on System 2.
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}\)</span> was internal to System 1, but it is

<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}} = {F_{\text{prof}} - f}},\]</span></p>

</div>
<p>The value of <span class="math inline">\(f{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em> is given, so we must
calculate net <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{net}}{}\)</span>. That can be done since both the
acceleration and mass of System 2 are known. Using Newton’s second law
we see that</p>
<div id="eip-id2367884" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}},\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where the mass of System 2 is 19.0 kg
(<span class="math inline">\(m{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em>= 12.0 kg + 7.0 kg) and its
acceleration was found to be <span class="math inline">\({{a = 1.5\ }\text{m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> in the

<p>Forces are given many names, such as push, pull, thrust, lift, weight,
friction, and tension. Traditionally, forces have been grouped into
several categories and given names relating to their source, how they
are transmitted, or their effects. The most important of these
categories are discussed in this section, together with some interesting
applications. Further examples of forces are discussed later in this
text.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.2</span> Normal Force</h3>
<p><span id="import-auto-id1910210" data-type="term">Weight</span> (also called force of
gravity) is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be
counteracted to keep an object from falling. You definitely notice that
you must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when
you hold it stationary, as illustrated in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2672874" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a). But how do
inanimate objects like a table support the weight of a mass placed on
them, such as shown in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2672874" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(b)? When the bag
of dog food is placed on the table, the table actually sags slightly
under the load. This would be noticeable if the load were placed on a
card table, but even rigid objects deform when a force is applied to
them. Unless the object is deformed beyond its limit, it will exert a
restoring force much like a deformed spring (or trampoline or diving
board). The greater the deformation, the greater the restoring force. So
when the load is placed on the table, the table sags until the restoring
force becomes as large as the weight of the load. At this point the net
external force on the load is zero. That is the situation when the load
is stationary on the table. The table sags quickly, and the sag is
slight so we do not notice it. But it is similar to the sagging of a
trampoline when you climb onto it.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_04_05_01.jpg" id="import-auto-id2672874" alt="" />
<p class="caption">(a) The person holding the bag of dog food must supply an upward force
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{hand}}{}\)</span> equal in magnitude and opposite in
direction to the weight of the food <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span>. (b) The card table
sags when the dog food is placed on it, much like a stiff trampoline.
Elastic restoring forces in the table grow as it sags until they supply
a force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span> equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to
the weight of the
load.</p>
</div>
<p>We must conclude that whatever supports a load, be it animate or not,
must supply an upward force equal to the weight of the load, as we
assumed in a few of the previous examples. If the force supporting a
load is perpendicular to the surface of contact between the load and its
support, this force is defined to be a <span id="import-auto-id1254224" data-type="term">normal
force</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> and here is given
the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span>. (This is not the unit for force N.) The word
<em>normal<!-- no-selfclose --></em> means perpendicular to a surface.
The normal force can be less than the object’s weight if the object is
on an incline, as you will see in the next example.</p>

<p>Common Misconception: Normal Force (N) vs. Newton (N)</p>
</div>
<p>In this section we have introduced the quantity normal force, which is
represented by the variable <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span>. This should not be confused
with the symbol for the newton, which is also represented by the letter
N. These symbols are particularly important to distinguish because the
units of a normal force (<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span>) happen to be newtons (N). For
example, the normal force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span> that the floor exerts on a
chair might be <span class="math inline">\({\textbf{N} = \text{100\ N}}{}\)</span>. One important
difference is that normal force is a vector, while the newton is simply
a unit. Be careful not to confuse these letters in your calculations!
You will encounter more similarities among variables and units as you
proceed in physics. Another example of this is the quantity work (<span class="math inline">\(W{}\)</span>)
and the unit watts (W).</p>

<p><span data-type="title">Strategy</span></p>
</div>
<p>This is a two-dimensional problem, since the forces on the skier (the
system of interest) are not parallel. The approach we have used in
two-dimensional kinematics also works very well here. Choose a
convenient coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes,
creating <em>two</em> connected <em>one</em>-dimensional problems to solve. The most
convenient coordinate system for motion on an incline is one that has
one coordinate parallel to the slope and one perpendicular to the slope.
(Remember that motions along mutually perpendicular axes are
independent.) We use the symbols <span class="math inline">\(\bot{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\parallel {}\)</span> to
represent perpendicular and parallel, respectively. This choice of axes
simplifies this type of problem, because there is no motion
perpendicular to the slope and because friction is always parallel to
the surface between two objects. The only external forces acting on the
system are the skier’s weight, friction, and the support of the slope,
respectively labeled <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{f}{}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span>
in <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2149297" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> is always perpendicular
to the slope, and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{f}{}\)</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> is
parallel to it. But <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span> is not in the direction of either
axis, and so the first step we take is to project it into components
along the chosen axes, defining <span class="math inline">\(w_{\parallel}\)</span> to be the component of
weight parallel to the slope and <span class="math inline">\(w_{\bot}{}\)</span> the component of weight
perpendicular to the slope. Once this is done, we can consider the two
separate problems of forces parallel to the slope and forces
perpendicular to the slope.</p>
<div class="tinysection">

<p>The magnitude of the component of the weight parallel to the slope is
<span class="math inline">\({{w_{\parallel} = \mathit{w}\ }\text{sin}\ (\text{25º}{) = {\mathit{mg}\ }}\text{sin}\ (\text{25º})}{}\)</span>,

<p>Since friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration
is smaller when there is friction than when there is none. In fact, it
is a general result that if friction on an incline is negligible, then
the acceleration down the incline is <span class="math inline">\({{a = g\ }\text{sin}\theta}{}\)</span>,
<em>regardless of mass</em>. This is related to the previously discussed fact
that all objects fall with the same acceleration in the absence of air

same).</p>

<p>When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta{}\)</span> with

into two components: a force acting perpendicular to the plane,

equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal force,
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{N}{}\)</span>. The force acting parallel to the plane,
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}_{\parallel}{}\)</span>, causes the object to accelerate down the

the object, so it acts upward along the plane.</p>
<p>It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.3</span> Tension</h3>
<p>A <span id="import-auto-id1608257" data-type="term">tension</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> is a force along the
length of a medium, especially a force carried by a flexible medium,
such as a rope or cable. The word “tension<em>"</em> comes from a Latin word
meaning”to stretch." Not coincidentally, the flexible cords that carry
muscle forces to other parts of the body are called <em>tendons</em>. Any
flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, wire, or cable, can
exert pulls only parallel to its length; thus, a force carried by a
flexible connector is a tension with direction parallel to the
connector. It is important to understand that tension is a pull in a
connector. In contrast, consider the phrase: “You can’t push a rope.”
The tension force pulls outward along the two ends of a rope.</p>
<p>Consider a person holding a mass on a rope as shown in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2715102" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure%2004_05_04.jpg" id="import-auto-id2715102" alt="" />
<p class="caption">When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend
it) such as this rope transmits a force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{T}{}\)</span>, that force must
be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull such a
flexible connector exerts is a tension. Note that the rope pulls with
equal force but in opposite directions on the hand and the supported
mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). This is an example of Newton’s
third law. The rope is the medium that carries the equal and opposite
forces between the two objects. The tension anywhere in the rope between
the hand and the mass is equal. Once you have determined the tension in
one location, you have determined the tension at all locations along the
rope.</p>
</div>
<p>Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we
can prove using Newton’s second law. If the 5.00-kg mass in the figure
is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, and thus
<span class="math inline">\({\textbf{F}_{\text{net}} = 0}{}\)</span>. The only external forces acting on
the mass are its weight <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong>
and the tension <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{T}{}\)</span> supplied by the rope. Thus,</p>
<div id="eip-id2555725" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{net}} = {T - w}} = 0},\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(T{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em> and
<span class="math inline">\(w{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em> are the magnitudes of the tension
and weight and their signs indicate direction, with up being positive
here. Thus, just as you would expect, the tension equals the weight of
the supported mass:</p>
<div id="eip-id1640254" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{T = w} = \text{mg}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>For a 5.00-kg mass, then (neglecting the mass of the rope) we see that</p>
<div id="eip-id2489897" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{T = \text{mg}} = (}\text{5.00\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}{) =}\text{49.0\ N}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>If we cut the rope and insert a spring, the spring would extend a length
corresponding to a force of 49.0 N, providing a direct observation and
measure of the tension force in the rope.</p>
<p>Flexible connectors are often used to transmit forces around corners,
such as in a hospital traction system, a finger joint, or a bicycle
brake cable. If there is no friction, the tension is transmitted
undiminished. Only its direction changes, and it is always parallel to
the flexible connector. This is illustrated in

</div>
<p>As you can see in the figure, the wire is not perfectly horizontal (it
cannot be!), but is bent under the person’s weight. Thus, the tension on
either side of the person has an upward component that can support his
weight. As usual, forces are vectors represented pictorially by arrows
having the same directions as the forces and lengths proportional to
their magnitudes. The system is the tightrope walker, and the only
external forces acting on him are his weight <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span> and the two
tensions <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{T}_{\text{L}}{}\)</span> (left
<sub><!-- no-selfclose --></sub> tension) and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{T}_{\text{R}}{}\)</span>
(right tension), as illustrated. It is reasonable to neglect the weight
of the wire itself. The net external force is zero since the system is
stationary. A little trigonometry can now be used to find the tensions.
One conclusion is possible at the outset—we can see from part (b) of
the figure that the magnitudes of the tensions <span class="math inline">\(T_{\text{L}}{}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(T_{\text{R}}{}\)</span> must be equal. This is because there is no horizontal
acceleration in the rope, and the only forces acting to the left and
right are <span class="math inline">\(T_{\text{L}}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{R}{}\)</span>. Thus, the magnitude of those
forces must be equal so that they cancel each other out.</p>
<p>Whenever we have two-dimensional vector problems in which no two vectors
are parallel, the easiest method of solution is to pick a convenient
coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes. In this case
the best coordinate system has one axis horizontal and the other
vertical. We call the horizontal the <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span>-axis

in opposite directions and cancel, and so most of the tension in the

linear acceleration (like a car slowing down). For example, if a
satellite is heading due north above Earth’s northern hemisphere, then
to an observer on Earth it will appear to experience a force to the west
that has no physical origin. Of course, what is happening here is that
Earth is rotating toward the east and moves east under the satellite. In
Earth’s frame this looks like a westward force on the satellite, or it
can be interpreted as a violation of Newton’s first law (the law of
inertia). An <span id="import-auto-id2695882" data-type="term">inertial frame of reference</span> is one in which all forces are real and, equivalently,
one in which Newton’s laws have the simple forms given in this chapter.</p>
<p>Earth’s rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame.
You ordinarily must perform precise experiments to observe fictitious
forces and the slight departures from Newton’s laws, such as the effect
just described. On the large scale, such as for the rotation of weather
systems and ocean currents, the effects can be easily observed.</p>
<p>The crucial factor in determining whether a frame of reference is
inertial is whether it accelerates or rotates relative to a known
inertial frame. Unless stated otherwise, all phenomena discussed in this
text are considered in inertial frames.</p>
<p>All the forces discussed in this section are real forces, but there are
a number of other real forces, such as lift and thrust, that are not
discussed in this section. They are more specialized, and it is not
necessary to discuss every type of force. It is natural, however, to ask
where the basic simplicity we seek to find in physics is in the long
list of forces. Are some more basic than others? Are some different
manifestations of the same underlying force? The answer to both
questions is yes, as will be seen in the next (extended) section and in
the treatment of modern physics later in the text.</p>

<p>Success in problem solving is obviously necessary to understand and
apply physical principles, not to mention the more immediate need of
passing exams. The basics of problem solving, presented earlier in this
text, are followed here, but specific strategies useful in applying
Newton’s laws of motion are emphasized. These techniques also reinforce
concepts that are useful in many other areas of physics. Many
problem-solving strategies are stated outright in the worked examples,
and so the following techniques should reinforce skills you have already
begun to develop.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.7.2</span> Problem-Solving Strategy for Newton’s Laws of Motion</h3>
<p>Step 1. As usual, it is first necessary to identify the physical
principles involved. <em>Once it is determined that Newton’s laws of motion
are involved (if the problem involves forces), it is particularly
important to draw a careful sketch of the situation</em>. Such a sketch is
shown in <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1669409" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a).
Then, as in <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1669409" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(b),
use arrows to represent all forces, label them carefully, and make their
lengths and directions correspond to the forces they represent (whenever
sufficient information exists).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure%2004_06_01.jpg" id="import-auto-id1669409" alt="" />
<p class="caption">(a) A sketch of Tarzan hanging from a vine. (b) Arrows are used to
represent all forces. <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{T}{}\)</span> is the tension in the vine above
Tarzan, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{T}}{}\)</span> is the force he exerts on the vine,
and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span> is his weight. All other forces, such as the nudge of
a breeze, are assumed negligible. (c) Suppose we are given the ape man’s
mass and asked to find the tension in the vine. We then define the
system of interest as shown and draw a free-body diagram.
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{T}}{}\)</span> is no longer shown, because it is not a force
acting on the system of interest; rather, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{T}}{}\)</span> acts
on the outside world. (d) Showing only the arrows, the head-to-tail
method of addition is used. It is apparent that
<span class="math inline">\({\textbf{T} = - \mathbf{w}}{}\)</span>, if Tarzan is
stationary.</p>
</div>
<p>Step 2. Identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be
inferred from the problem as stated. That is, make a list of knowns and
unknowns. <em>Then carefully determine the system of interest</em>. This
decision is a crucial step, since Newton’s second law involves only
external forces. Once the system of interest has been identified, it
becomes possible to determine which forces are external and which are
internal, a necessary step to employ Newton’s second law. (See
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1669409" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(c).) Newton’s
third law may be used to identify whether forces are exerted between
components of a system (internal) or between the system and something
outside (external). As illustrated earlier in this chapter, the system
of interest depends on what question we need to answer. This choice
becomes easier with practice, eventually developing into an almost
unconscious process. Skill in clearly defining systems will be
beneficial in later chapters as well. <span data-type="newline"><br />
</span><span data-type="newline"><br />
</span>A diagram showing the system of interest and all
of the external forces is called a <span id="import-auto-id1606094" data-type="term">free-body
diagram</span>. Only forces are shown
on free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. We have drawn
several of these in worked examples.
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1669409" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(c) shows a
free-body diagram for the system of interest. Note that no internal
forces are shown in a free-body diagram.</p>
<p>Step 3. Once a free-body diagram is drawn, <em>Newton’s second law can be
applied to solve the problem</em>. This is done in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1669409" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(d) for a
particular situation. In general, once external forces are clearly
identified in free-body diagrams, it should be a straightforward task to
put them into equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in all
previous examples. If the problem is one-dimensional—that is, if all
forces are parallel—then they add like scalars. If the problem is
two-dimensional, then it must be broken down into a pair of
one-dimensional problems. This is done by projecting the force vectors
onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous examples,
the choice of axes can simplify the problem. For example, when an
incline is involved, a set of axes with one axis parallel to the incline
and one perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always
convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion, if this
is known.</p>

<div data-type="title">
<p>Applying Newton’s Second Law</p>
</div>
<p>Before you write net force equations, it is critical to determine
whether the system is accelerating in a particular direction. If the
acceleration is zero in a particular direction, then the net force is
zero in that direction. Similarly, if the acceleration is nonzero in a
particular direction, then the net force is described by the equation:
<span class="math inline">\({F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if the system is accelerating in the horizontal direction,
but it is not accelerating in the vertical direction, then you will have
the following conclusions:</p>
<div id="eip-id1449134" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}\ x} = \text{ma}},\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="eip-id1478667" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}\ y} = 0}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>You will need this information in order to determine unknown forces
acting in a system.</p>
</div>
<p>Step 4. As always, <em>check the solution to see whether it is reasonable</em>.
In some cases, this is obvious. For example, it is reasonable to find
that friction causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than
when no friction exists. In practice, intuition develops gradually
through problem solving, and with experience it becomes progressively
easier to judge whether an answer is reasonable. Another way to check
your solution is to check the units. If you are solving for force and
end up with units of m/s, then you have made a mistake.</p>

<p>Drag Force on a Barge</p>

<p>Suppose two tugboats push on a barge at different angles, as shown in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1221020" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. The first
tugboat exerts a force of <span class="math inline">\({2.7{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}}{}\)</span> in
the <em>x</em>-direction, and the second tugboat exerts a force of
<span class="math inline">\({3.6{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}}{}\)</span> in the <em>y</em>-direction.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_04_07_01.jpg" id="import-auto-id1221020" alt="" />
<p class="caption">(a) A view from above of two tugboats pushing on a barge. (b) The
free-body diagram for the ship contains only forces acting in the plane
of the water. It omits the two vertical forces—the weight of the barge
and the buoyant force of the water supporting it cancel and are not
shown. Since the applied forces are perpendicular, the <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-axes
are in the same direction as <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{x}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{y}{}\)</span>.
The problem quickly becomes a one-dimensional problem along the
direction of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span>, since friction is in the
direction opposite to
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>If the mass of the barge is <span class="math inline">\({{5.0 \times \text{10}^{6}}\ \text{kg}}{}\)</span>
and its acceleration is observed to be
<span class="math inline">\({7\text{.}{\text{5} \times \text{10}^{- 2}}\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> in the
direction shown, what is the drag force of the water on the barge
resisting the motion? (Note: drag force is a frictional force exerted by
fluids, such as air or water. The drag force opposes the motion of the
object.)</p>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Strategy</span></p>
</div>
<p>The directions and magnitudes of acceleration and the applied forces are
given in <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1221020" class="autogenerated-content">link</a><strong>(a)</strong>.
We will define the total force of the tugboats on the barge as
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span> so that:</p>
<div id="eip-id1203757" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}\text{=}\textbf{F}_{\mathit{x}} + \textbf{F}_{\mathit{y}}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Since the barge is flat bottomed, the drag of the water
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{D}}{}\)</span> will be in the direction opposite to
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span>, as shown in the free-body diagram in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1221020" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(b). The system of
interest here is the barge, since the forces on
<em>it<!-- no-selfclose --></em> are given as well as its
acceleration. Our strategy is to find the magnitude and direction of the
net applied force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span>, and then apply Newton’s
second law to solve for the drag force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{D}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution</span></p>
</div>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{x}{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em> and
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{y}{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em> are perpendicular,
the magnitude and direction of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span> are easily
found. First, the resultant magnitude is given by the Pythagorean
theorem:</p>
<div id="eip-id2112578" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{lllll}
F_{\text{app}} &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{\text{F}_{x}^{2} + \text{F}_{y}^{2}} &amp; &amp; \\
F_{\text{app}} &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{(2.7{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}{)^{2} + (}3.6{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N})^{2}} &amp; = &amp; {{4.5 \times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N.}} \\
\end{array}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The angle is given by</p>
<div id="eip-id3026466" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{lll}
\theta &amp; = &amp; {\text{tan}^{- 1}\left( \frac{F_{y}}{F_{x}} \right)} \\
\theta &amp; = &amp; {\text{tan}^{- 1}{\left( \frac{3.6{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}}{2.7{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}} \right) = \text{53º}},} \\
\end{array}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>which we know, because of Newton’s first law, is the same direction as
the acceleration. <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{D}}{}\)</span> is in the opposite direction
of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span>, since it acts to slow down the
acceleration. Therefore, the net external force is in the same direction
as <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span>, but its magnitude is slightly less than
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}\)</span>. The problem is now one-dimensional. From
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1221020" class="autogenerated-content">link</a><strong>(b)</strong>, we can
see that</p>
<div id="eip-id1624544" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}} = {F_{\text{app}} - F_{\text{D}}}}.\]</span></p>

<p>But Newton’s second law states that</p>
<div id="eip-id1230866" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}.\]</span></p>

<p>Thus,</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{app}} - F_{\text{D}}} = \text{ma}}.\]</span></p>

<p>This can be solved for the magnitude of the drag force of the water
<span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{D}}{}\)</span> in terms of known quantities:</p>
<div id="eip-id1464099" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{D}} = {F_{\text{app}} - \text{ma}}}.\]</span></p>

<p>The direction of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{D}}{}\)</span> has already been determined

<p>The numbers used in this example are reasonable for a moderately large
barge. It is certainly difficult to obtain larger accelerations with
tugboats, and small speeds are desirable to avoid running the barge into
the docks. Drag is relatively small for a well-designed hull at low
speeds, consistent with the answer to this example, where
<span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{D}}{}\)</span> is less than 1/600th of the weight of the ship.</p>
</div>
<p>In the earlier example of a tightrope walker we noted that the tensions
in wires supporting a mass were equal only because the angles on either
side were equal. Consider the following example, where the angles are

(e) The free-body diagram shows the vertical and horizontal forces
acting on the traffic

</div>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Strategy</span></p>
</div>
<p>The system of interest is the traffic light, and its free-body diagram
is shown in <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id3051538" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(c).
The three forces involved are not parallel, and so they must be
projected onto a coordinate system. The most convenient coordinate
system has one axis vertical and one horizontal, and the vector
projections on it are shown in part (d) of the figure. There are two
unknowns in this problem (<span class="math inline">\(T_{1}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}{}\)</span>), so two equations are
needed to find them. These two equations come from applying Newton’s
second law along the vertical and horizontal axes, noting that the net
external force is zero along each axis because acceleration is zero.</p>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution</span></p>
</div>
<p>First consider the horizontal or <em>x</em>-axis:</p>
<div id="eip-id2514755" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{net}x} = {T_{\text{2}x} - T_{\text{1}x}}} = 0}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Thus, as you might expect,</p>
<div id="eip-id2540452" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{T_{\text{1}x} = T_{\text{2}x}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This gives us the following relationship between <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}{}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(T_{2}{}\)</span>:</p>
<div id="eip-id2122298" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{T_{1}\ \text{cos}\ (\text{30º}{) = T_{2}}\ \text{cos}\ (\text{45º})}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Thus,</p>
<div id="eip-id2577136" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{T_{2} = (}1\text{.}\text{225})T_{1}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}{}\)</span> are not equal in this case, because
the angles on either side are not equal. It is reasonable that <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}{}\)</span>
ends up being greater than <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}{}\)</span>, because it is exerted more
vertically than <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider the force components along the vertical or <em>y</em>-axis:</p>
<div id="eip-id2308230" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{net}\ y} = {{T_{\text{1}y} + T_{\text{2}y}} - w}} = 0}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This implies</p>
<div id="eip-id1339509" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{T_{\text{1}y} + T_{\text{2}y}} = w}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Substituting the expressions for the vertical components gives</p>
<div id="eip-id1925561" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{T_{1}\ \text{sin}\ (\text{30º}{) + T_{2}}\ \text{sin}\ (\text{45º}{) = w}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are two unknowns in this equation, but substituting the expression
for <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}{}\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}{}\)</span> reduces this to one equation with
one unknown:</p>
<div id="eip-id2259246" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{T_{1}(0\text{.}\text{500}{) + (}1\text{.}\text{225}T_{1})(0\text{.}\text{707}{{) = w} = \text{mg}}},\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>which yields</p>
<div id="eip-id2556360" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{\left( {1\text{.}\text{366}} \right){T_{1} = (}\text{15}\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2})}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Solving this last equation gives the magnitude of
<span class="math inline">\(T_{1}{}\)</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> to be</p>
<div id="eip-id1747068" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{T_{1} = \text{108\ N}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Finally, the magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}{}\)</span> is determined using the relationship
between them, <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}{}\)</span> = 1.225 <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}{}\)</span>, found above. Thus we obtain</p>
<div id="eip-id1744019" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{T_{2} = \text{132\ N}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Discussion</span></p>
</div>
<p>Both tensions would be larger if both wires were more horizontal, and
they will be equal if and only if the angles on either side are the same
(as they were in the earlier example of a tightrope walker).</p>
</div>
<p>The bathroom scale is an excellent example of a normal force acting on a
body. It provides a quantitative reading of how much it must push upward
to support the weight of an object. But can you predict what you would
see on the dial of a bathroom scale if you stood on it during an
elevator ride? Will you see a value greater than your weight when the
elevator starts up? What about when the elevator moves upward at a
constant speed: will the scale still read more than your weight at rest?
Consider the following example.</p>

numerous forces acting on the elevator, scale, and person. It makes this

in <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id347645" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(b). Analysis of
the free-body diagram using Newton’s laws can produce answers to both
parts (a) and (b) of this example, as well as some other questions that

<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}{}\)</span> and the upward force of the scale
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{s}}{}\)</span>. According to Newton’s third law
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{p}}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{s}}{}\)</span> are equal in
magnitude and opposite in direction, so that we need to find
<span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{s}}{}\)</span> in order to find what the scale reads. We can do this,
as usual, by applying Newton’s second law,</p>
<div id="eip-id2548908" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>From the free-body diagram we see that
<span class="math inline">\({F_{\text{net}} = {F_{\text{s}} - w}}{}\)</span>, so that</p>
<div id="eip-id2522872" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{s}} - w} = \text{ma}}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Solving for <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{s}}{}\)</span> gives an equation with only one unknown:</p>

<p>In this part of the problem, <span class="math inline">\({a = 1.20\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>, so that</p>

<p>This is about 185 lb. What would the scale have read if he were
stationary? Since his acceleration would be zero, the force of the scale
would be equal to his weight:</p>
<div id="eip-id2384618" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{lll}
F_{\text{net}} &amp; = &amp; {\text{ma} = 0 = {F_{\text{s}} - w}} \\

F_{\text{s}} &amp; = &amp; {(\text{75.0\ kg})(9.\text{80\ m/s}^{2})} \\
F_{\text{s}} &amp; = &amp; \text{735\ N.} \\
\end{array}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>So, the scale reading in the elevator is greater than his 735-N (165 lb)
weight. This means that the scale is pushing up on the person with a
force greater than his weight, as it must in order to accelerate him
upward. Clearly, the greater the acceleration of the elevator, the
greater the scale reading, consistent with what you feel in rapidly
accelerating versus slowly accelerating elevators.</p>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution for (b)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now, what happens when the elevator reaches a constant upward velocity?
Will the scale still read more than his weight? For any constant
velocity—up, down, or stationary—acceleration is zero because
<span class="math inline">\({a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}}{}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\({\Delta v = 0}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus,</p>
<div id="eip-id2587837" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{s}} = {\text{ma} + \text{mg}}} = {0 + \text{mg}}}.\]</span></p>

<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{s}} = (}\text{75}\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2})},\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>which gives</p>
<div id="eip-id1499798" data-type="equation">

</div>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Discussion for (b)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The scale reading is 735 N, which equals the person’s weight. This will
be the case whenever the elevator has a constant velocity—moving up,
moving down, or stationary.</p>
</div>
<p>The solution to the previous example also applies to an elevator
accelerating downward, as mentioned. When an elevator accelerates
downward, <span class="math inline">\(a{}\)</span> is negative, and the scale reading is <em>less</em> than the
weight of the person, until a constant downward velocity is reached, at
which time the scale reading again becomes equal to the person’s weight.
If the elevator is in free-fall and accelerating downward at <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>, then
the scale reading will be zero and the person will <em>appear</em> to be
weightless.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.2</span> Integrating Concepts: Newton’s Laws of Motion and Kinematics</h3>
<p>Physics is most interesting and most powerful when applied to general
situations that involve more than a narrow set of physical principles.
Newton’s laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that
have been discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion.
For example, forces produce accelerations, a topic of kinematics, and
hence the relevance of earlier chapters. When approaching problems that
involve various types of forces, acceleration, velocity, and/or
position, use the following steps to approach the problem:</p>
<p><strong>Problem-Solving Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Step 1. <em>Identify which physical principles are involved</em>. Listing the
givens and the quantities to be calculated will allow you to identify
the principles involved. <span data-type="newline"><br />
</span>Step 2. <em>Solve the problem using strategies
outlined in the text</em>. If these are available for the specific topic,
you should refer to them. You should also refer to the sections of the
text that deal with a particular topic. The following worked example
illustrates how these strategies are applied to an integrated concept
problem.</p>

<p>This worked example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies
to situations that include topics from different chapters. The first
step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The
second step is to solve for the unknown using familiar problem-solving
strategies. These strategies are found throughout the text, and many
worked examples show how to use them for single topics. You will find
these techniques for integrated concept problems useful in applications
of physics outside of a physics course, such as in your profession, in

<ul>
<li>Understand the four basic forces that underlie the processes in
nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information presented in this section supports the following AP®

<ul>
<li><strong>3.C.4.1</strong> The student is able to make claims about various contact
forces between objects based on the microscopic cause of those
forces. <strong>(S.P. 6.1)</strong></li>
<li><strong>3.C.4.2</strong> The student is able to explain contact forces (tension,
friction, normal, buoyant, spring) as arising from interatomic
electric forces and that they therefore have certain directions.
<strong>(S.P. 6.2)</strong></li>
<li><strong>3.G.1.1</strong> The student is able to articulate situations when the
gravitational force is the dominant force and when the
electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces can be ignored. <strong>(S.P.
7.1)</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most remarkable simplifications in physics is that only four
distinct forces account for all known phenomena. In fact, nearly all of
the forces we experience directly are due to only one basic force,
called the electromagnetic force. (The gravitational force is the only
force we experience directly that is not electromagnetic.) This is a
tremendous simplification of the myriad of <em>apparently</em> different forces
we can list, only a few of which were discussed in the previous section.
As we will see, the basic forces are all thought to act through the
exchange of microscopic carrier particles, and the characteristics of
the basic forces are determined by the types of particles exchanged.
Action at a distance, such as the gravitational force of Earth on the
Moon, is explained by the existence of a <span id="import-auto-id2990636" data-type="term">force
field</span> rather than by “physical
contact.”</p>
<p>The <em>four basic forces</em> are the gravitational force, the electromagnetic
force, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. Their
properties are summarized in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1588108" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. Since the weak
and strong nuclear forces act over an extremely short range, the size of
a nucleus or less, we do not experience them directly, although they are
crucial to the very structure of matter. These forces determine which
nuclei are stable and which decay, and they are the basis of the release
of energy in certain nuclear reactions. Nuclear forces determine not
only the stability of nuclei, but also the relative abundance of
elements in nature. The properties of the nucleus of an atom determine
the number of electrons it has and, thus, indirectly determine the
chemistry of the atom. More will be said of all of these topics in later
chapters.</p>

<p>The gravitational force is surprisingly weak—it is only because
gravity is always attractive that we notice it at all. Our weight is the
gravitational force due to the <em>entire<!-- no-selfclose --></em>
Earth acting on us. On the very large scale, as in astronomical systems,
the gravitational force is the dominant force determining the motions of
moons, planets, stars, and galaxies. The gravitational force also
affects the nature of space and time. As we shall see later in the study
of general relativity, space is curved in the vicinity of very massive
bodies, such as the Sun, and time actually slows down near massive
bodies.</p>
<p>Take a good look at the ranges for the four fundamental forces listed in
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1588108" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. The range of the
strong nuclear force, 10<sup>−15</sup> m, is approximately the size of the
nucleus of an atom; the weak nuclear force has an even shorter range. At
scales on the order of 10−10 m, approximately the size of an atom, both
nuclear forces are completely dominated by the electromagnetic force.
Notice that this scale is still utterly tiny compared to our everyday
experience. At scales that we do experience daily, electromagnetism
tends to be negligible, due to its attractive and repulsive properties
canceling each other out. That leaves gravity, which is usually the
strongest of the forces at scales above ~10<sup>−4</sup> m, and hence includes
our everyday activities, such as throwing, climbing stairs, and walking.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic forces can be either attractive or repulsive. They are
long-range forces, which act over extremely large distances, and they
nearly cancel for macroscopic objects. (Remember that it is the <em>net</em>
external force that is important.) If they did not cancel,
electromagnetic forces would completely overwhelm the gravitational
force. The electromagnetic force is a combination of electrical forces
(such as those that cause static electricity) and magnetic forces (such
as those that affect a compass needle). These two forces were thought to
be quite distinct until early in the 19th century, when scientists began
to discover that they are different manifestations of the same force.
This discovery is a classical case of the <em>unification of forces</em>.
Similarly, friction, tension, and all of the other classes of forces we
experience directly (except gravity, of course) are due to
electromagnetic interactions of atoms and molecules. It is still
convenient to consider these forces separately in specific applications,
however, because of the ways they manifest themselves.</p>

<div data-type="title">
<p>Concept Connections: Unifying Forces</p>
</div>
<p>Attempts to unify the four basic forces are discussed in relation to
elementary particles later in this text. By “unify” we mean finding
connections between the forces that show that they are different
manifestations of a single force. Even if such unification is achieved,
the forces will retain their separate characteristics on the macroscopic
scale and may be identical only under extreme conditions such as those
existing in the early universe.</p>
</div>
<p>Physicists are now exploring whether the four basic forces are in some
way related. Attempts to unify all forces into one come under the rubric
of Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), with which there has been some success
in recent years. It is now known that under conditions of extremely high
density and temperature, such as existed in the early universe, the
electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are indistinguishable. They can
now be considered to be different manifestations of one force, called
the <em>electroweak</em> force. So the list of four has been reduced in a sense
to only three. Further progress in unifying all forces is proving
difficult—especially the inclusion of the gravitational force, which
has the special characteristics of affecting the space and time in which
the other forces exist.</p>
<p>While the unification of forces will not affect how we discuss forces in
this text, it is fascinating that such underlying simplicity exists in
the face of the overt complexity of the universe. There is no reason
that nature must be simple—it simply is.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.9.2</span> Action at a Distance: Concept of a Field</h3>
<p>All forces act at a distance. This is obvious for the gravitational
force. Earth and the Moon, for example, interact without coming into
contact. It is also true for all other forces. Friction, for example, is
an electromagnetic force between atoms that may not actually touch. What
is it that carries forces between objects? One way to answer this
question is to imagine that a <span id="import-auto-id3093199" data-type="term">force field</span> surrounds whatever object creates the force. A second
object (often called a <em>test object</em>) placed in this field will
experience a force that is a function of location and other variables.
The field itself is the “thing” that carries the force from one object
to another. The field is defined so as to be a characteristic of the
object creating it; the field does not depend on the test object placed
in it. Earth’s gravitational field, for example, is a function of the
mass of Earth and the distance from its center, independent of the
presence of other masses. The concept of a field is useful because
equations can be written for force fields surrounding objects (for
gravity, this yields <span class="math inline">\({w = \text{mg}}{}\)</span> at Earth’s surface), and
motions can be calculated from these equations. (See
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1577565" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.)</p>

<p>Concept Connections: Force Fields</p>
</div>
<p>The concept of a <strong>force field</strong> is also used in connection with
electric charge and is presented in <a href="/m55297">Electric Charge and Electric
Field</a>. It is also a useful idea for all the basic forces, as
will be seen in <a href="/m54854">Particle Physics</a>. Fields help us to visualize
forces and how they are transmitted, as well as to describe them with
precision and to link forces with subatomic carrier particles.</p>

<div id="fs-id1399053" data-type="title">
<p>Making Connections: Vector and Scalar Fields</p>
</div>
<p>These fields may be either scalar or vector fields. Gravity and
electromagnetism are examples of vector fields. A test object placed in
such a field will have both the magnitude and direction of the resulting
force on the test object completely defined by the object’s location in
the field. We will later cover examples of scalar fields, which have a
magnitude but no direction.</p>
</div>
<p>The field concept has been applied very successfully; we can calculate
motions and describe nature to high precision using field equations. As
useful as the field concept is, however, it leaves unanswered the
question of what carries the force. It has been proposed in recent
decades, starting in 1935 with Hideki Yukawa’s (1907–1981) work on the
strong nuclear force, that all forces are transmitted by the exchange of
elementary particles. We can visualize particle exchange as analogous to
macroscopic phenomena such as two people passing a basketball back and
forth, thereby exerting a repulsive force without touching one another.
(See <a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2011579" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_04_08_02.jpg" id="import-auto-id2011579" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The exchange of masses resulting in repulsive forces. (a) The person
throwing the basketball exerts a force
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{p1}}{}\)</span><sub><!-- no-selfclose --></sub> on it toward
the other person and feels a reaction force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{B}}\)</span> away
from the second person. (b) The person catching the basketball exerts a
force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{p2}}\)</span> on it to stop the ball and feels a
reaction force <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F&#39;}_{\text{B}}{}\)</span> away from the first person.
(c) The analogous exchange of a meson between a proton and a neutron
carries the strong nuclear forces <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F}_{\text{exch}}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{F&#39;}_{\text{exch}}\)</span> between them. An attractive force can also
be exerted by the exchange of a mass—if person 2 pulled the basketball
away from the first person as he tried to retain it, then the force
between them would be
attractive.</p>
</div>
<p>This idea of particle exchange deepens rather than contradicts field
concepts. It is more satisfying philosophically to think of something
physical actually moving between objects acting at a distance.
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id1588108" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> lists the
exchange or <span id="import-auto-id1561662" data-type="term">carrier particles</span>, both observed and proposed, that carry the four
forces. But the real fruit of the particle-exchange proposal is that
searches for Yukawa’s proposed particle found it <em>and</em> a number of
others that were completely unexpected, stimulating yet more research.
All of this research eventually led to the proposal of quarks as the
underlying substructure of matter, which is a basic tenet of GUTs. If
successful, these theories will explain not only forces, but also the
structure of matter itself. Yet physics is an experimental science, so
the test of these theories must lie in the domain of the real world. As
of this writing, scientists at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland are
starting to test these theories using the world’s largest particle
accelerator: the Large Hadron Collider. This accelerator (27 km in
circumference) allows two high-energy proton beams, traveling in
opposite directions, to collide. An energy of 14 trillion electron volts
will be available. It is anticipated that some new particles, possibly
force carrier particles, will be found. (See
<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id2658974" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.) One of the
force carriers of high interest that researchers hope to detect is the
Higgs boson. The observation of its properties might tell us why
different particles have different masses.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">The world’s largest particle accelerator spans the border between
Switzerland and France. Two beams, traveling in opposite directions
close to the speed of light, collide in a tube similar to the central
tube shown here. External magnets determine the beam’s path. Special
detectors will analyze particles created in these collisions. Questions
as broad as what is the origin of mass and what was matter like the
first few seconds of our universe will be explored. This accelerator
began preliminary operation in 2008. (credit: Frank
Hommes)</p>
</div>
<p>Tiny particles also have wave-like behavior, something we will explore
more in a later chapter. To better understand force-carrier particles
from another perspective, let us consider gravity. The search for
gravitational waves has been going on for a number of years. Almost 100
years ago, Einstein predicted the existence of these waves as part of
his general theory of relativity. Gravitational waves are created during
the collision of massive stars, in black holes, or in supernova
explosions—like shock waves. These gravitational waves will travel
through space from such sites much like a pebble dropped into a pond
sends out ripples—except these waves move at the speed of light. A
detector apparatus has been built in the U.S., consisting of two large
installations nearly 3000 km apart—one in Washington state and one in
Louisiana! The facility is called the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Each installation is designed to
use optical lasers to examine any slight shift in the relative positions
of two masses due to the effect of gravity waves. The two sites allow
simultaneous measurements of these small effects to be separated from
other natural phenomena, such as earthquakes. Initial operation of the
detectors began in 2002, and work is proceeding on increasing their
sensitivity. Similar installations have been built in Italy (VIRGO),
Germany (GEO600), and Japan (TAMA300) to provide a worldwide network of
gravitational wave detectors.</p>
<p>International collaboration in this area is moving into space with the
joint EU/US project LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna).
Earthquakes and other Earthly noises will be no problem for these
monitoring spacecraft. LISA will complement LIGO by looking at much more
massive black holes through the observation of gravitational-wave
sources emitting much larger wavelengths. Three satellites will be
placed in space above Earth in an equilateral triangle (with
5,000,000-km sides)
(<a href="dynamics-force-and-newtons-laws-of-motion.html#import-auto-id3032532" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>). The system
will measure the relative positions of each satellite to detect passing
gravitational waves. Accuracy to within 10% of the size of an atom will
be needed to detect any waves. The launch of this project might be as
early as 2018.</p>
<p><em>“I’m sure LIGO will tell us something about the universe that we didn’t
know before. The history of science tells us that any time you go where
you haven’t been before, you usually find something that really shakes
the scientific paradigms of the day. Whether gravitational wave
astrophysics will do that, only time will tell.”</em> —David Reitze, LIGO
Input Optics Manager, University of Florida</p>

relative to the electromagnetic force? Since the weak nuclear force acts
at only very short distances, such as inside nuclei, where the strong
and electromagnetic forces also act, it might seem surprising that we
have any knowledge of it at all. We have such knowledge because the weak
nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, a type of nuclear decay not
explained by other forces.</p>

<p>What is the ratio of the strength of the strong nuclear force to that of
the electromagnetic force? Based on this ratio, you might expect that
the strong force dominates the nucleus, which is true for small nuclei.
Large nuclei, however, have sizes greater than the range of the strong
nuclear force. At these sizes, the electromagnetic force begins to
affect nuclear stability. These facts will be used to explain nuclear
fusion and fission later in this text.</p>

<p class="caption">Everyday motion that we experience is, thankfully, rarely as tortuous
as a rollercoaster ride like this—the Dragon Khan in Spain's
Universal Port Aventura Amusement Park. However, most motion is in
curved, rather than straight-line, paths. Motion along a curved path is
two- or three-dimensional motion, and can be described in a similar
fashion to one-dimensional motion. (credit: Boris23/Wikimedia

</div>
<p>Most instances of motion in everyday life involve changes in
displacement and velocity that occur in more than one direction. For
example, when you take a long road trip, you drive on different roads in
different directions for different amounts of time at different speeds.
How can these motions all be combined to determine information about the
trip such as the total displacement and average velocity? If you kick a
ball from ground level at some angle above the horizontal, how can you
describe its motion? To what maximum height does the object rise above
the ground? How long is the object in the air? How much horizontal
distance is covered before the ball lands? To answer questions such as
these, we need to describe motion in two dimensions.</p>
<p>Examining two-dimensional motion requires an understanding of both the
scalar and the vector quantities associated with the motion. You will
learn how to combine vectors to incorporate both the magnitude and
direction of vectors into your analysis. You will learn strategies for
simplifying the calculations involved by choosing the appropriate
reference frame and by treating each dimension of the motion separately
as a one-dimensional problem, but you will also see that the motion
itself occurs in the same way regardless of your chosen reference frame
(Essential Knowledge 3.A.1).</p>
<p>This chapter lays a necessary foundation for examining interactions of
objects described by forces (Big Idea 3). Changes in direction result
from acceleration, which necessitates force on an object. In this
chapter, you will concentrate on describing motion that involves changes
in direction. In later chapters, you will apply this understanding as
you learn about how forces cause these motions (Enduring Understanding
3.A). The concepts in this chapter support:</p>
<p><strong>Big Idea 3</strong> The interactions of an object with other objects can be
described by forces.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.A All forces share certain common
characteristics when considered by observers in inertial reference
frames.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.A.1 An observer in a particular reference frame
can describe the motion of an object using such quantities as position,
displacement, distance, velocity, speed, and acceleration.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to walk from one point to another in a city with
uniform square blocks, as pictured in

<p class="caption">A pedestrian walks a two-dimensional path between two points in a
city. In this scene, all blocks are square and are the same
size.</p>
</div>
<p>The straight-line path that a helicopter might fly is blocked to you as
a pedestrian, and so you are forced to take a two-dimensional path, such
as the one shown. You walk 14 blocks in all, 9 east followed by 5 north.
What is the straight-line distance?</p>
<p>An old adage states that the shortest distance between two points is a
straight line. The two legs of the trip and the straight-line path form
a right triangle, and so the Pythagorean theorem,
<span class="math inline">\({a^{2}\text{~+~}b^{2}\text{~=~}c^{2}}{}\)</span>, can be used to find the
straight-line distance.</p>

<p>The fact that the straight-line distance (10.3 blocks) in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1165298535408" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> is less
than the total distance walked (14 blocks) is one example of a general
characteristic of vectors. (Recall that
<span id="import-auto-id1165298541000" data-type="term">vectors</span> are quantities
that have both magnitude and direction.)</p>
<p>As for one-dimensional kinematics, we use arrows to represent vectors.
The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector's magnitude. The
arrow's length is indicated by hash marks in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1165296250183" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> and
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1165298535408" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. The arrow
points in the same direction as the vector. For two-dimensional motion,
the path of an object can be represented with three vectors: one vector
shows the straight-line path between the initial and final points of the
motion, one vector shows the horizontal component of the motion, and one
vector shows the vertical component of the motion. The horizontal and
vertical components of the motion add together to give the straight-line
path. For example, observe the three vectors in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1165298535408" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. The first
represents a 9-block displacement east. The second represents a 5-block
displacement north. These vectors are added to give the third vector,
with a 10.3-block total displacement. The third vector is the
straight-line path between the two points. Note that in this example,
the vectors that we are adding are perpendicular to each other and thus
form a right triangle. This means that we can use the Pythagorean
theorem to calculate the magnitude of the total displacement. (Note that
we cannot use the Pythagorean theorem to add vectors that are not
perpendicular. We will develop techniques for adding vectors having any
direction, not just those perpendicular to one another, in <a href="/m54781">Vector
Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods</a> and <a href="/m54783">Vector

<p>Independence of Motion</p>
</div>
<p>The horizontal and vertical components of two-dimensional motion are
independent of each other. Any motion in the horizontal direction does
not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.</p>
</div>
<p>This is true in a simple scenario like that of walking in one direction
first, followed by another. It is also true of more complicated motion
involving movement in two directions at once. For example, let's
compare the motions of two baseballs. One baseball is dropped from rest.
At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same height
and follows a curved path. A stroboscope has captured the positions of
the balls at fixed time intervals as they fall.</p>

3.6</a>, that the vertical motion of the two
balls is independent of the horizontal motion. As you think about your
experiment, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will you measure the horizontal and vertical positions of each
ball over time? What equipment will this require?</li>
<li>How will you measure the time interval between each of your position
measurements? What equipment will this require?</li>
<li>If you were to create separate graphs of the horizontal velocity for
each ball versus time, what do you predict it would look like?
Explain.</li>
<li>If you were to compare graphs of the vertical velocity for each ball
versus time, what do you predict it would look like? Explain.</li>
<li>If there is a significant amount of air resistance, how will that
affect each of your graphs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Design a two-dimensional ballistic motion experiment that demonstrates
the relationship between the maximum height reached by an object and the
object's time of flight. As you think about your experiment, consider
the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will you measure the maximum height reached by your object?</li>
<li>How can you take advantage of the symmetry of an object in ballistic
motion launched from ground level, reaching maximum height, and
returning to ground level?</li>
<li>Will it make a difference if your object has no horizontal component
to its velocity? Explain.</li>
<li>Will you need to measure the time at multiple different positions?
Why or why not?</li>
<li>Predict what a graph of travel time versus maximum height will look
like. Will it be linear? Parabolic? Horizontal? Explain the shape of
your predicted graph qualitatively or quantitatively.</li>
<li>If there is a significant amount of air resistance, how will that
affect your measurements and your results?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical
positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity implies that
the vertical motion is independent of whether or not the ball is moving
horizontally. (Assuming no air resistance, the vertical motion of a
falling object is influenced by gravity only, and not by any horizontal
forces.) Careful examination of the ball thrown horizontally shows that
it travels the same horizontal distance between flashes. This is due to
the fact that there are no additional forces on the ball in the
horizontal direction after it is thrown. This result means that the
horizontal velocity is constant, and affected neither by vertical motion
nor by gravity (which is vertical). Note that this case is true only for
ideal conditions. In the real world, air resistance will affect the
speed of the balls in both directions.</p>
<p>The two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is
composed of two independent one-dimensional motions (horizontal and
vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called <strong>projectile
motion</strong>, is to <strong>resolve</strong> (break) it into motions along perpendicular
directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular
components is possible because the components are independent. We shall
see how to resolve vectors in <a href="/m54781">Vector Addition and Subtraction:

<p>The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any
number of vectors. It is also important to note that the resultant is
independent of the order in which the vectors are added. Therefore, we
could add the vectors in any order as illustrated in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1165298931858" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> and we will
still get the same solution.</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure_03_02_12.jpg" id="import-auto-id1165298931858" /></p>
<p>Here, we see that when the same vectors are added in a different order,
the result is the same. This characteristic is true in every case and is
an important characteristic of vectors. Vector addition is
<span data-type="term">commutative</span>. Vectors can be added in any order.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Vector Subtraction</h3>
<p>Vector subtraction is a straightforward extension of vector addition. To
define subtraction (say we want to subtract <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{B}\)</span> from
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}\)</span> , written <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}–\textbf{B}\)</span> , we must first define
what we mean by subtraction. The <em>negative</em> of a vector <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{B}{}\)</span>
is defined to be <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{–B}\)</span>; that is, graphically <em>the negative of
any vector has the same magnitude but the opposite direction</em>, as shown
in <a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1165298692950" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. In
other words, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{B}{}\)</span> has the same length as <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{–B}{}\)</span>, but
points in the opposite direction. Essentially, we just flip the vector
so it points in the opposite direction.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_03_02_13a.jpg" id="import-auto-id1165298692950" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The negative of a vector is just another vector of the same magnitude
but pointing in the opposite direction. So <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{B}{}\)</span> is the
negative of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{–B}{}\)</span>; it has the same length but opposite
direction.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>subtraction</strong> of vector <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{B}{}\)</span> from vector <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}{}\)</span>
is then simply defined to be the addition of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{–B}{}\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}{}\)</span>. Note that vector subtraction is the addition of a
negative vector. The order of subtraction does not affect the results.</p>
<div id="eip-454" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{\text{A~–~B~=~A~+~}(\text{–B})}{}\text{.}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This is analogous to the subtraction of scalars (where, for example,
<span class="math inline">\({\text{5~–~2~=~5~+~}(\text{–2})}{}\)</span>). Again, the result is independent
of the order in which the subtraction is made. When vectors are
subtracted graphically, the techniques outlined above are used, as the
following example illustrates.</p>

<p>We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{A}\)</span>,

<span class="math inline">\({180{^\circ}–112{^\circ} = 68{^\circ}}{}\)</span> south of east. We represent
this as <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{–B}{}\)</span>, as shown below. The vector <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{–B}\)</span> has
the same magnitude as <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{B}\)</span> but is in the opposite direction.
Thus, she will end up at a location <span class="math inline">\({\textbf{A} +}(\textbf{–B})\)</span>, or

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5</span> Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars</h3>
<p>If we decided to walk three times as far on the first leg of the trip
considered in the preceding example, then we would walk
<span class="math inline">\({{\text{3~} \times \text{~27}}\text{.}\text{5\ m}}{}\)</span>, or 82.5 m, in a
direction <span class="math inline">\({\text{66}\text{.}0\text{°}}{}\)</span> north of east. This is an
example of multiplying a vector by a positive
<span id="import-auto-id1165296219603" data-type="term">scalar</span>. Notice that the
magnitude changes, but the direction stays the same.</p>
<p>If the scalar is negative, then multiplying a vector by it changes the
vector's magnitude and gives the new vector the <strong>opposite</strong> direction.
For example, if you multiply by –2, the magnitude doubles but the
direction changes. We can summarize these rules in the following way:
When vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}{}\)</span> is multiplied by a scalar <span class="math inline">\(c{}\)</span>,</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="import-auto-id1165298651742">the magnitude of the vector becomes the absolute value of
<span class="math inline">\(c{}\)</span><span class="math inline">\(A{}\)</span>,</span></li>
<li><span id="import-auto-id1165298881521">if <span class="math inline">\(c{}\)</span> is positive, the direction of the vector does not
change,</span></li>
<li><span id="import-auto-id1165298455414">if <span class="math inline">\(c{}\)</span> is negative, the direction is
reversed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In our case, <span class="math inline">\(c = 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A = 27.5\ m\)</span>. Vectors are multiplied by
scalars in many situations. Note that division is the inverse of
multiplication. For example, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by
the value (1/2). The rules for multiplication of vectors by scalars are
the same for division; simply treat the divisor as a scalar between 0
and 1.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.6</span> Resolving a Vector into Components</h3>
<p>In the examples above, we have been adding vectors to determine the
resultant vector. In many cases, however, we will need to do the
opposite. We will need to take a single vector and find what other
vectors added together produce it. In most cases, this involves
determining the perpendicular <span id="import-auto-id1165298555736" data-type="term">components</span>of a single vector, for example the <strong>x</strong>- <em>and</em>
<strong>y</strong>-components, or the north-south and east-west components.</p>
<p>For example, we may know that the total displacement of a person walking
in a city is 10.3 blocks in a direction <span class="math inline">\(\text{29}\text{.0°}\)</span> north of
east and want to find out how many blocks east and north had to be
walked. This method is called <strong>finding the components (or parts)</strong> of
the displacement in the east and north directions, and it is the inverse
of the process followed to find the total displacement. It is one
example of finding the components of a vector. There are many
applications in physics where this is a useful thing to do. We will see
this soon in <a href="/m54787">Projectile Motion</a>, and much more when we cover
<strong>forces</strong> in <a href="/m54802">Dynamics: Newton's Laws of Motion</a>. Most of
these involve finding components along perpendicular axes (such as north
and east), so that right triangles are involved. The analytical
techniques presented in <a href="/m54783">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical
Methods</a> are ideal for finding vector components.</p>

vector addition and subtraction employ geometry and simple trigonometry
rather than the ruler and protractor of graphical methods. Part of the
graphical technique is retained, because vectors are still represented
by arrows for easy visualization. However, analytical methods are more
concise, accurate, and precise than graphical methods, which are limited
by the accuracy with which a drawing can be made. Analytical methods are
limited only by the accuracy and precision with which physical

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Resolving a Vector into Perpendicular Components</h3>
<p>Analytical techniques and right triangles go hand-in-hand in physics
because (among other things) motions along perpendicular directions are
independent. We very often need to separate a vector into perpendicular
components. For example, given a vector like <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}{}\)</span> in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1165298677803" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, we may
wish to find which two perpendicular vectors, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_{x}{}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_{y}{}\)</span>, add to produce it.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">The vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}{}\)</span>, with its tail at the origin of an <em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>-coordinate system, is shown together with its <em>x</em>- and
<em>y</em>-components, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_{x}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_{y}{}\)</span>. These vectors
form a right triangle. The analytical relationships among these vectors
are summarized

<p><span class="math display">\[{{\mathbf{A}_{x}\text{~+~A}_{y}\text{~=~A}}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Note that this relationship between vector components and the resultant
vector holds only for vector quantities (which include both magnitude
and direction). The relationship does not apply for the magnitudes
alone. For example, if <span class="math inline">\({\textbf{A}_{x} = 3\ m}{}\)</span> east,
<span class="math inline">\({\textbf{A}_{y} = 4\ m}{}\)</span> north, and <span class="math inline">\({\textbf{A} = 5\ m}{}\)</span>
north-east, then it is true that the vectors
<span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{A}_{x}\text{~+~A}_{y}\text{~=~A}}{}\)</span>. However, it is <strong>not</strong>
true that the sum of the magnitudes of the vectors is also equal. That

</div>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> represent two legs of a walk (two
displacements), then <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> is the total displacement. The person
taking the walk ends up at the tip of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}.\)</span> There are many ways
to arrive at the same point. In particular, the person could have walked
first in the <em>x</em>-direction and then in the <em>y</em>-direction. Those paths
are the <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-components of the resultant, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_{x}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_{y}{}\)</span>. If we know <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{R}_{x}{}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_{y}{}\)</span>, we can find <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> using the equations
<span class="math inline">\(A = \sqrt{{A_{x}}^{2} + {A_{y}}^{2}}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\theta = \text{tan}^{–1}(A_{y}/A_{x})\)</span>. When you use the analytical
method of vector addition, you can determine the components or the
magnitude and direction of a vector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Step 1.</strong> </em>Identify the x- and y-axes that will be used in the
problem. Then, find the components of each vector to be added along the
chosen perpendicular axes<em>.</em> Use the equations
<span class="math inline">\({{A_{x} = A}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}{}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\({{A_{y} = A}\ \text{sin}\ \theta}{}\)</span> to find the components. In
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1165296674934" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, these
components are <span class="math inline">\(A_{x}{}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_{y}{}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B_{x}{}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(B_{y}{}\)</span>. The
angles that vectors <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}{}\)</span> make with the
<strong>x</strong>-axis are <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{\text{A}}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{\text{B}}{}\)</span>,
respectively.</p>

</div>
<p>Components along the same axis, say the <strong>x</strong>-axis, are vectors along
the same line and, thus, can be added to one another like ordinary
numbers. The same is true for components along the <strong>y</strong>-axis. (For
example, a 9-block eastward walk could be taken in two legs, the first 3
blocks east and the second 6 blocks east, for a total of 9, because they
are along the same direction.) So resolving vectors into components
along common axes makes it easier to add them. Now that the components
of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}{}\)</span> are known, its magnitude and direction can be found.</p>
<p><em><strong>Step 3.</strong> </em>To get the magnitude <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> of the resultant, use the
Pythagorean theorem:**</p>

<p>This example illustrates the addition of vectors using perpendicular
components. Vector subtraction using perpendicular components is very
similar—it is just the addition of a negative vector.</p>
<p>Subtraction of vectors is accomplished by the addition of a negative
vector. That is,
<span class="math inline">\({{{\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}} \equiv {{\mathbf{A} + (}\mathbf{–B}}})}{}\)</span>.
Thus, <em>the method for the subtraction of vectors using perpendicular

<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{–B}{}\)</span> are the negatives of the components of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}{}\)</span>.
The <em>x</em>- and <strong>y</strong>-components of the resultant

<p><span class="math display">\[{R_{y} = {A_{y} + \left( –B_{y} \right)}}{}\]</span></p>

<p><span id="import-auto-id1560216" data-type="term">Projectile motion</span> is the
<span id="import-auto-id1846113" data-type="term">motion</span> of an object thrown or
projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The
object is called a <span id="import-auto-id1809247" data-type="term">projectile</span>, and its path is called its
<span id="import-auto-id1397020" data-type="term">trajectory</span>. The motion of
falling objects, as covered in <a href="/m54774">Problem-Solving Basics for
One-Dimensional Kinematics</a>, is a simple one-dimensional type
of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement. In this
section, we consider two-dimensional projectile motion, such as that of
a football or other object for which <span id="import-auto-id1230666" data-type="term">air
resistance</span> <strong>is negligible</strong>.</p>
<p>The most important fact to remember here is that <strong>motions along
perpendicular axes are independent</strong> and thus can be analyzed
separately. This fact was discussed in <a href="/m54779">Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An
Introduction</a>, where vertical and horizontal motions were seen
to be independent. The key to analyzing two-dimensional projectile
motion is to break it into two motions, one along the horizontal axis
and the other along the vertical. (This choice of axes is the most
sensible, because acceleration due to gravity is vertical—thus, there
will be no acceleration along the horizontal axis when air resistance is
negligible.) As is customary, we call the horizontal axis the <strong>x</strong>-axis
and the vertical axis the <strong>y</strong>-axis.
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id2242290" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> illustrates the
notation for displacement, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{s}{}\)</span> is defined to be the
total displacement and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y}{}\)</span> are its
components along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The
magnitudes of these vectors are <strong>s</strong>, <strong>x</strong>, and <strong>y</strong>. (Note that in
the last section we used the notation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}{}\)</span> to represent a
vector with components <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_{x}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_{y}{}\)</span>. If we
continued this format, we would call displacement <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{s}{}\)</span> with
components <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{s}_{x}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{s}_{y}{}\)</span>. However, to
simplify the notation, we will simply represent the component vectors as
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y}{}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Of course, to describe motion we must deal with velocity and
acceleration, as well as with displacement. We must find their
components along the <strong>x</strong>- and <strong>y</strong>-axes, too. We will assume all
forces except gravity (such as air resistance and friction, for example)
are negligible. The components of acceleration are then very simple:
<span class="math inline">\({{a_{y} = –g} = –9.80\ m\text{/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>. (Note that this definition
assumes that the upwards direction is defined as the positive direction.
If you arrange the coordinate system instead such that the downwards
direction is positive, then acceleration due to gravity takes a positive
value.) Because gravity is vertical, <span class="math inline">\({a_{x} = 0}{}\)</span>. Both accelerations
are constant, so the kinematic equations can be used.</p>

<p>Note that because up is positive, the initial velocity is positive, as
is the maximum height, but the acceleration due to gravity is negative.
Note also that the maximum height depends only on the vertical component
of the initial velocity, so that any projectile with a 67.6 m/s initial
vertical component of velocity will reach a maximum height of 233 m
(neglecting air resistance). The numbers in this example are reasonable
for large fireworks displays, the shells of which do reach such heights
before exploding. In practice, air resistance is not completely
negligible, and so the initial velocity would have to be somewhat larger
than that given to reach the same height.</p>

<p>As in many physics problems, there is more than one way to solve for the

<p>Defining a Coordinate System</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to set up a coordinate system when analyzing projectile
motion. One part of defining the coordinate system is to define an
origin for the <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y{}\)</span> positions. Often, it is convenient to
choose the initial position of the object as the origin such that
<span class="math inline">\({x_{0} = 0}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({y_{0} = 0}{}\)</span>. It is also important to define the
positive and negative directions in the <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y{}\)</span> directions.
Typically, we define the positive vertical direction as upwards, and the
positive horizontal direction is usually the direction of the object's
motion. When this is the case, the vertical acceleration, <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>, takes a
negative value (since it is directed downwards towards the Earth).
However, it is occasionally useful to define the coordinates
differently. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of a ball
thrown downwards from the top of a cliff, it may make sense to define
the positive direction downwards since the motion of the ball is solely
in the downwards direction. If this is the case, <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span> takes a positive
value.</p>

<p>Again, resolving this two-dimensional motion into two independent

<p>The negative angle means that the velocity is

consistent with the fact that the final vertical velocity is negative
and hence downward—as you would expect because the final altitude is

</div>
<p>One of the most important things illustrated by projectile motion is
that vertical and horizontal motions are independent of each other.
Galileo was the first person to fully comprehend this characteristic. He
used it to predict the range of a projectile. On level ground, we define
<span id="import-auto-id1751163" data-type="term">range</span> to be the horizontal
distance <span class="math inline">\(R{}\)</span> traveled by a projectile. Galileo and many others were
interested in the range of projectiles primarily for military
purposes—such as aiming cannons. However, investigating the range of
projectiles can shed light on other interesting phenomena, such as the
orbits of satellites around the Earth. Let us consider projectile range
further.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_03_04_05a.jpg" id="import-auto-id1904800" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Trajectories of projectiles on level ground. (a) The greater the
initial speed <span class="math inline">\(v_{0}{}\)</span>, the greater the range for a given initial
angle. (b) The effect of initial angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{0}{}\)</span> on the range of a
projectile with a given initial speed. Note that the range is the same
for <span class="math inline">\(\text{15°}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{75°}{}\)</span>, although the maximum heights of
those paths are
different.</p>
</div>
<p>How does the initial velocity of a projectile affect its range?
Obviously, the greater the initial speed <span class="math inline">\(v_{0}{}\)</span>, the greater the
range, as shown in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1904800" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a). The initial
angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{0}{}\)</span> also has a dramatic effect on the range, as
illustrated in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1904800" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(b). For a fixed
initial speed, such as might be produced by a cannon, the maximum range
is obtained with <span class="math inline">\({\theta_{0} = \text{45°}}{}\)</span>. This is true only for
conditions neglecting air resistance. If air resistance is considered,
the maximum angle is approximately <span class="math inline">\(\text{38°}{}\)</span>. Interestingly, for
every initial angle except <span class="math inline">\(\text{45°}{}\)</span>, there are two angles that
give the same range—the sum of those angles is <span class="math inline">\(\text{90°}{}\)</span>. The
range also depends on the value of the acceleration of gravity <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>.
The lunar astronaut Alan Shepherd was able to drive a golf ball a great
distance on the Moon because gravity is weaker there. The range <span class="math inline">\(R{}\)</span> of
a projectile on <strong>level ground</strong> for which air resistance is negligible
is given by</p>
<div id="eip-240" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{R = \frac{v_{0}^{2}\ \text{sin}\ {2\theta}_{0}}{g}}\text{,}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(v_{0}{}\)</span> is the initial speed and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{0}{}\)</span> is the initial
angle relative to the horizontal. The proof of this equation is left as
an end-of-chapter problem (hints are given), but it does fit the major
features of projectile range as described.</p>
<p>When we speak of the range of a projectile on level ground, we assume
that <span class="math inline">\(R{}\)</span> is very small compared with the circumference of the Earth.
If, however, the range is large, the Earth curves away below the
projectile and acceleration of gravity changes direction along the path.
The range is larger than predicted by the range equation given above
because the projectile has farther to fall than it would on level
ground. (See <a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1645881" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.) If
the initial speed is great enough, the projectile goes into orbit. This
possibility was recognized centuries before it could be accomplished.
When an object is in orbit, the Earth curves away from underneath the
object at the same rate as it falls. The object thus falls continuously
but never hits the surface. These and other aspects of orbital motion,
such as the rotation of the Earth, will be covered analytically and in
greater depth later in this text.</p>
<p>Once again we see that thinking about one topic, such as the range of a
projectile, can lead us to others, such as the Earth orbits. In
<a href="/m55089">Addition of Velocities</a>, we will examine the addition of
velocities, which is another important aspect of two-dimensional
kinematics and will also yield insights beyond the immediate topic.</p>

initial speed, the range increases and becomes longer than it would be

achieved.</p>

the angle at which it is fired. For all but the maximum, there are two

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Relative Velocity</h3>
<p>If a person rows a boat across a rapidly flowing river and tries to head
directly for the other shore, the boat instead moves <strong>diagonally</strong>
relative to the shore, as in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1635451" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. The boat does
not move in the direction in which it is pointed. The reason, of course,
is that the river carries the boat downstream. Similarly, if a small
airplane flies overhead in a strong crosswind, you can sometimes see
that the plane is not moving in the direction in which it is pointed, as
illustrated in <a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1851600" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.
The plane is moving straight ahead relative to the air, but the movement
of the air mass relative to the ground carries it sideways.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_03_05_01a.jpg" id="import-auto-id1635451" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A boat trying to head straight across a river will actually move
diagonally relative to the shore as shown. Its total velocity (solid
arrow) relative to the shore is the sum of its velocity relative to the
river plus the velocity of the river relative to the
shore.</p>

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">An airplane heading straight north is instead carried to the west and
slowed down by wind. The plane does not move relative to the ground in
the direction it points; rather, it moves in the direction of its total
velocity (solid

</div>
<p>In each of these situations, an object has a
<span id="import-auto-id1831655" data-type="term">velocity</span> relative to a medium
(such as a river) and that medium has a velocity relative to an observer
on solid ground. The velocity of the object <strong>relative to the observer</strong>
is the sum of these velocity vectors, as indicated in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1635451" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> and
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1851600" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. These situations
are only two of many in which it is useful to add velocities. In this
module, we first re-examine how to add velocities and then consider
certain aspects of what relative velocity means.</p>
<p>How do we add velocities? Velocity is a vector (it has both magnitude
and direction); the rules of <span id="import-auto-id1402169" data-type="term">vector addition</span> discussed in <a href="/m54781">Vector Addition and Subtraction:
Graphical Methods</a> and <a href="/m54783">Vector Addition and Subtraction:
Analytical Methods</a> apply to the addition of velocities, just
as they do for any other vectors. In one-dimensional motion, the
addition of velocities is simple—they add like ordinary numbers. For
example, if a field hockey player is moving at <span class="math inline">\(\text{5~m/s}{}\)</span> straight
toward the goal and drives the ball in the same direction with a
velocity of <span class="math inline">\(\text{30~m/s}{}\)</span> relative to her body, then the velocity of
the ball is <span class="math inline">\(\text{35~m/s}{}\)</span> relative to the stationary, profusely
sweating goalkeeper standing in front of the goal.</p>
<p>In two-dimensional motion, either graphical or analytical techniques can
be used to add velocities. We will concentrate on analytical techniques.
The following equations give the relationships between the magnitude and
direction of velocity (<span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta{}\)</span>) and its components
(<span class="math inline">\(v_{x}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{y}{}\)</span>) along the <strong>x</strong>- and <strong>y</strong>-axes of an
appropriately chosen coordinate system:</p>

and
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{v}_{y}{}\)</span>.</p>

<p>These equations are valid for any vectors and are adapted specifically
for velocity. The first two equations are used to find the components of
a velocity when its magnitude and direction are known. The last two are
used to find the magnitude and direction of velocity when its components

<p>Refer to <a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id2070798" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, which

<p>In this problem, somewhat different from the previous example, we know

two other velocities, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{v}_{\text{w}}{}\)</span> (the wind) and

quantity <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{v}_{\text{p}}{}\)</span> is known, and we are asked to find
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{v}_{\text{w}}{}\)</span>. None of the velocities are perpendicular, but
it is possible to find their components along a common set of
perpendicular axes. If we can find the components of
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{v}_{\text{w}}{}\)</span>, then we can combine them to solve for its

<p>The wind's speed and direction are consistent with the significant
effect the wind has on the total velocity of the plane, as seen in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1546060" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. Because the
plane is fighting a strong combination of crosswind and head-wind, it
ends up with a total velocity significantly less than its velocity
relative to the air mass as well as heading in a different direction.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that in both of the last two examples, we were able to make the
mathematics easier by choosing a coordinate system with one axis
parallel to one of the velocities. We will repeatedly find that choosing
an appropriate coordinate system makes problem solving easier. For
example, in projectile motion we always use a coordinate system with one
axis parallel to gravity.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.3</span> Relative Velocities and Classical Relativity</h3>
<p>When adding velocities, we have been careful to specify that the
<strong>velocity is relative to some reference frame</strong>. These velocities are
called <span id="import-auto-id1929302" data-type="term">relative velocities</span>.
For example, the velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is
different from its velocity relative to the ground. Both are quite
different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its passengers
(which should be close to zero). Relative velocities are one aspect of
<span id="import-auto-id1982113" data-type="term">relativity</span>, which is defined
to be the study of how different observers moving relative to each other
measure the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone has heard of relativity and immediately associates it
with Albert Einstein (1879–1955), the greatest physicist of the 20th
century. Einstein revolutionized our view of nature with his <strong>modern</strong>
theory of relativity, which we shall study in later chapters. The
relative velocities in this section are actually aspects of classical
relativity, first discussed correctly by Galileo and Isaac Newton.
<span id="import-auto-id1447237" data-type="term">Classical relativity</span> is
limited to situations where speeds are less than about 1% of the speed
of light—that is, less than <span class="math inline">\(\text{3,000~km/s}{}\)</span>. Most things we
encounter in daily life move slower than this speed.</p>
<p>Let us consider an example of what two different observers see in a
situation analyzed long ago by Galileo. Suppose a sailor at the top of a
mast on a moving ship drops his binoculars. Where will it hit the deck?
Will it hit at the base of the mast, or will it hit behind the mast
because the ship is moving forward? The answer is that if air resistance
is negligible, the binoculars will hit at the base of the mast at a
point directly below its point of release. Now let us consider what two
different observers see when the binoculars drop. One observer is on the
ship and the other on shore. The binoculars have no horizontal velocity
relative to the observer on the ship, and so he sees them fall straight
down the mast. (See
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1892076" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.) To the observer
on shore, the binoculars and the ship have the <strong>same</strong> horizontal
velocity, so both move the same distance forward while the binoculars
are falling. This observer sees the curved path shown in
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1892076" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. Although the
paths look different to the different observers, each sees the same
result—the binoculars hit at the base of the mast and not behind it.
To get the correct description, it is crucial to correctly specify the
velocities relative to the observer.</p>

The initial horizontal velocity is different relative to the two

effect.)</p>

<p>Calculating Relative Velocity: An Airline Passenger Drops a Coin</p>

<p>An airline passenger drops a coin while the plane is moving at 260 m/s.
What is the velocity of the coin when it strikes the floor 1.50 m below
its point of release: (a) Measured relative to the plane? (b) Measured
relative to the Earth?</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">The motion of a coin dropped inside an airplane as viewed by two

</div>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Strategy</span></p>
</div>
<p>Both problems can be solved with the techniques for falling objects and
projectiles. In part (a), the initial velocity of the coin is zero
relative to the plane, so the motion is that of a falling object
(one-dimensional). In part (b), the initial velocity is 260 m/s
horizontal relative to the Earth and gravity is vertical, so this motion
is a projectile motion. In both parts, it is best to use a coordinate
system with vertical and horizontal axes.</p>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution for (a)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Using the given information, we note that the initial velocity and
position are zero, and the final position is 1.50 m. The final velocity
can be found using the equation:</p>
<div id="eip-313" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{{v_{y}}^{2} = {{v_{0,y}}^{2} - 2g}}({y - y_{0}})}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Substituting known values into the equation, we get</p>
<div id="eip-444" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{v_{y}}^{2} = {0^{2} - 2}}(9\text{.}\text{80}\ \text{m/s}^{2}){( - 1}\text{.}\text{50}\ {\text{m} - 0\ m}{) = \text{29}}\text{.}4\ \text{m}^{2}\text{/s}^{2}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>yielding</p>
<div id="eip-877" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{v_{y} = {- 5}}\text{.}\text{42\ m/s.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>We know that the square root of 29.4 has two roots: 5.42 and -5.42. We
choose the negative root because we know that the velocity is directed
downwards, and we have defined the positive direction to be upwards.
There is no initial horizontal velocity relative to the plane and no
horizontal acceleration, and so the motion is straight down relative to
the plane.</p>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution for (b)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Because the initial vertical velocity is zero relative to the ground and
vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion, the final vertical
velocity for the coin relative to the ground is
<span class="math inline">\(v_{y} = - 5.42\ \text{m/s}\)</span>, the same as found in part (a). In contrast
to part (a), there now is a horizontal component of the velocity.
However, since there is no horizontal acceleration, the initial and
final horizontal velocities are the same and
<span class="math inline">\({v_{x} = \text{260~m/s}}{}\)</span>. The <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-components of velocity
can be combined to find the magnitude of the final velocity:</p>
<div id="eip-558" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{v = \sqrt{{v_{x}}^{2} + {v_{y}}^{2}}}\text{.}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Thus,</p>
<div id="eip-842" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{v = \sqrt{(\text{260\ m/s}{{)^{2} + (} - 5}\text{.}\text{42\ m/s})^{2}}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>yielding</p>
<div id="eip-98" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{v = \text{260}}\text{.}\text{06\ m/s.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The direction is given by:</p>
<div id="eip-73" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({v_{y}/v_{x}}{) = \text{tan}^{- 1}}{( - 5}\text{.}{\text{42}/\text{260}})}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>so that</p>
<div id="eip-328" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}{( - 0}\text{.}\text{0208}{) = {- 1}}\text{.}\text{19º}}\text{.}\]</span></p>

<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Discussion</span></p>
</div>
<p>In part (a), the final velocity relative to the plane is the same as it
would be if the coin were dropped from rest on the Earth and fell 1.50
m. This result fits our experience; objects in a plane fall the same way
when the plane is flying horizontally as when it is at rest on the
ground. This result is also true in moving cars. In part (b), an
observer on the ground sees a much different motion for the coin. The
plane is moving so fast horizontally to begin with that its final
velocity is barely greater than the initial velocity. Once again, we see
that in two dimensions, vectors do not add like ordinary numbers—the
final velocity v in part (b) is <strong>not</strong>
<span class="math inline">\({(\text{260\ –\ 5}\text{.}\text{42})\text{~m/s}}{}\)</span>; rather, it is
<span class="math inline">\({\text{260}\text{.}\text{06~m/s}}{}\)</span>. The velocity's magnitude had to
be calculated to five digits to see any difference from that of the
airplane. The motions as seen by different observers (one in the plane
and one on the ground) in this example are analogous to those discussed
for the binoculars dropped from the mast of a moving ship, except that
the velocity of the plane is much larger, so that the two observers see
<strong>very</strong> different paths. (See
<a href="two-dimensional-kinematics.html#import-auto-id1944737" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.) In addition,
both observers see the coin fall 1.50 m vertically, but the one on the
ground also sees it move forward 144 m (this calculation is left for the
reader). Thus, one observer sees a vertical path, the other a nearly
horizontal path.</p>

for five galaxies lying along a straight line, with the Milky Way Galaxy
at the center. Using the data from the figure, calculate the velocities:
(a) relative to galaxy 2 and (b) relative to galaxy 5. The results mean
that observers on all galaxies will see themselves at the center of the
expanding universe, and they would likely be aware of relative
velocities, concluding that it is not possible to locate the center of
expansion with the given information.</p>

<p class="caption">Five galaxies on a straight line, showing their distances and
velocities relative to the Milky Way (MW) Galaxy. The distances are in
millions of light years (Mly), where a light year is the distance light
travels in one year. The velocities are nearly proportional to the
distances. The sizes of the galaxies are greatly exaggerated; an average
galaxy is about 0.1 Mly

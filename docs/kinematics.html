<p>Wo man auch hinsieht, beobachtet man Körper in Bewegung.
Objects are in motion everywhere we look. Everything from a tennis game
to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you
are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in
inanimate objects, there is a continuous motion in the vibrations of
atoms and molecules. Questions about motion are interesting in and of
themselves: <em>How long will it take for a space probe to get to Mars?
Where will a football land if it is thrown at a certain angle?</em></p>
<p>Understanding motion will not only provide answers to these questions,
but will be key to understanding more advanced concepts in physics. For
example, the discussion of force in Chapter 4 will not fully make sense
until you understand acceleration. This relationship between force and
acceleration is also critical to understanding Big Idea 3.</p>
<p>Additionally, this unit will explore the topic of reference frames, a
critical component to quantifying how things move. If you have ever
waved to a departing friend at a train station, you are likely familiar
with this idea. While you see your friend move away from you at a
considerable rate, those sitting with her will likely see her as not
moving. The effect that the chosen reference frame has on your
observations is substantial, and an understanding of this is needed to
grasp both Enduring Understanding 3.A and Essential Knowledge 3.A.1.</p>
<p>Our formal study of physics begins with <strong>kinematics,</strong> which is defined
as the <em>study of motion without considering its causes</em>. In one- and
two-dimensional kinematics we will study only the <em>motion</em> of a
football, for example, without worrying about what forces cause or
change its motion. In this chapter, we examine the simplest type of
motion—namely, motion along a straight line, or one-dimensional
motion. Later, in two-dimensional kinematics, we apply concepts
developed here to study motion along curved paths (two- and
three-dimensional motion), for example, that of a car rounding a curve.</p>
<p>The content in this chapter supports:</p>
<p><strong>Big Idea 3</strong> The interactions of an object with other objects can be
described by forces.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.A All forces share certain common
characteristics when considered by observers in inertial reference
frames.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.A.1 An observer in a particular reference frame
can describe the motion of an object using such quantities as position,
displacement, distance, velocity, speed, and acceleration.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Position</h3>
<p>In order to describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to
describe its <span data-type="term">position</span>—where it is at any
particular time. More precisely, you need to specify its position
relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a
reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it
relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a
rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket
with respect to the Earth as a whole, while a professor's position
could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby
white board. (See
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id2972079" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.) In other cases,
we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion
relative to the Earth. To describe the position of a person in an
airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not the Earth, as the
reference frame. (See
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id2707699" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.)</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Displacement</h3>
<p>If an object moves relative to a reference frame (for example, if a
professor moves to the right relative to a white board or a passenger
moves toward the rear of an airplane), then the object's position
changes. This change in position is known as
<span data-type="term">displacement</span>. The word “displacement” implies that
an object has moved, or has been displaced.</p>
<div id="fs-id3206000" class="note" data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label="">
<div data-type="title">
<p>Displacement</p>
</div>
<p>Displacement is the <em>change in position</em> of an object:</p>
<div id="eip-458" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{\text{Δ}x = {x_{\text{f}} - x_{0}},}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\({\text{Δ}x}{}\)</span> is displacement, <span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{f}}{}\)</span> is the final
position, and <em><!-- no-selfclose --></em><span class="math inline">\(x_{0}{}\)</span> is the initial
position.</p>
</div>
<p>In this text the upper case Greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\text{Δ}{}\)</span> (delta) always

means <em>change in position</em>. Always solve for displacement by subtracting
initial position <span class="math inline">\(x_{0}{}\)</span> from final position <span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{f}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter (m) (see <a href="/m54765">Physical
Quantities and Units</a>), but sometimes kilometers, miles, feet,
and other units of length are used. Keep in mind that when units other
than the meter are used in a problem, you may need to convert them into
meters to complete the calculation.</p>

<p>Note that displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude. The
professor's displacement is 2.0 m to the right, and the airline
passenger's displacement is 4.0 m toward the rear. In one-dimensional
motion, direction can be specified with a plus or minus sign. When you
begin a problem, you should select which direction is positive (usually
that will be to the right or up, but you are free to select positive as
being any direction). The professor's initial position is
<span class="math inline">\({{x_{0} = 1}\text{.}5\ \text{m}}{}\)</span> and her final position is
<span class="math inline">\({{x_{\text{f}} = 3}\text{.}5\ \text{m}}{}\)</span>. Thus her displacement is</p>

<p>In this coordinate system, motion to the right is positive, whereas
motion to the left is negative. Similarly, the airplane passenger's
initial position is <span class="math inline">\({x_{0} = 6}\text{.}0\ m\)</span> and his final position is

<p>Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is
not. <span data-type="term">Distance</span> is defined to be <em>the magnitude or
size of displacement between two positions</em>. Note that the distance
between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between
them. <span data-type="term">Distance traveled</span> is <em>the total length of the

<p>Misconception Alert: Distance Traveled vs. Magnitude of Displacement</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to note that the <em>distance traveled</em>,
<em><!-- no-selfclose --></em>however, can be greater than the
magnitude of the displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of
the displacement without regard to its direction; that is, just a number
with a unit). For example, the professor could pace back and forth many
times, perhaps walking a distance of 150 m during a lecture, yet still
end up only 2.0 m to the right of her starting point. In this case her
displacement would be +2.0 m, the magnitude of her displacement would be
2.0 m, but the distance she traveled would be 150 m. In kinematics we
nearly always deal with displacement and magnitude of displacement, and
almost never with distance traveled. One way to think about this is to
assume you marked the start of the motion and the end of the motion. The
displacement is simply the difference in the position of the two marks
and is independent of the path taken in traveling between the two marks.
The distance traveled, however, is the total length of the path taken
between the two marks.</p>

<p>What is the difference between distance and displacement? Whereas
displacement is defined by both direction and magnitude, distance is
defined only by magnitude. Displacement is an example of a vector
quantity. Distance is an example of a scalar quantity. A
<span id="import-auto-id1738434" data-type="term">vector</span> is any quantity with
both <em>magnitude and direction</em>. Other examples of vectors include a
velocity of 90 km/h east and a force of 500 newtons straight down.</p>
<p>The direction of a vector in one-dimensional motion is given simply by a
plus <span class="math inline">\({( + )}{}\)</span> or minus <span class="math inline">\({( - )}{}\)</span> sign. Vectors are represented
graphically by arrows. An arrow used to represent a vector has a length
proportional to the vector's magnitude (e.g., the larger the magnitude,
the longer the length of the vector) and points in the same direction as
the vector.</p>
<p>Some physical quantities, like distance, either have no direction or
none is specified. A <span id="import-auto-id1759638" data-type="term">scalar</span>
is any quantity that has a magnitude, but no direction. For example, a
<span class="math inline">\(\text{20ºC}\)</span> temperature, the 250 kilocalories (250 Calories) of energy
in a candy bar, a 90 km/h speed limit, a person's 1.8 m height, and a
distance of 2.0 m are all scalars—quantities with no specified
direction. Note, however, that a scalar can be negative, such as a
<span class="math inline">\(- \text{20ºC}\)</span> temperature. In this case, the minus sign indicates a
point on a scale rather than a direction. Scalars are never represented
by arrows.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Coordinate Systems for One-Dimensional Motion</h3>
<p>In order to describe the direction of a vector quantity, you must
designate a coordinate system within the reference frame. For
one-dimensional motion, this is a simple coordinate system consisting of
a one-dimensional coordinate line. In general, when describing
horizontal motion, motion to the right is usually considered positive,
and motion to the left is considered negative. With vertical motion,
motion up is usually positive and motion down is negative. In some
cases, however, as with the jet in
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id1778274" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, it can be more
convenient to switch the positive and negative directions. For example,
if you are analyzing the motion of falling objects, it can be useful to
define downwards as the positive direction. If people in a race are
running to the left, it is useful to define left as the positive
direction. It does not matter as long as the system is clear and
consistent. Once you assign a positive direction and start solving a
problem, you cannot change it.</p>

<p>Switching Reference Frames</p>
</div>
<p>A fundamental tenet of physics is that information about an event can be
gathered from a variety of reference frames. For example, imagine that
you are a passenger walking toward the front of a bus. As you walk, your
motion is observed by a fellow bus passenger and by an observer standing
on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Both the bus passenger and sidewalk observer will be able to collect
information about you. They can determine how far you moved and how much
time it took you to do so. However, while you moved at a consistent
pace, both observers will get different results. To the passenger
sitting on the bus, you moved forward at what one would consider a
normal pace, something similar to how quickly you would walk outside on
a sunny day. To the sidewalk observer though, you will have moved much
quicker. Because the bus is also moving forward, the distance you move
forward against the sidewalk each second increases, and the sidewalk
observer must conclude that you are moving at a greater pace.</p>
<p>To show that you understand this concept, you will need to create an
event and think of a way to view this event from two different frames of
reference. In order to ensure that the event is being observed
simultaneously from both frames, you will need an assistant to help out.
An example of a possible event is to have a friend ride on a skateboard
while tossing a ball. How will your friend observe the ball toss, and
how will those observations be different from your own?</p>
<p>Your task is to describe your event and the observations of your event
from both frames of reference. Answer the following questions below to
demonstrate your understanding. For assistance, you can review the
information given in the ’Position' paragraph at the start of Section
2.1.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is your event? What object are both you and your assistant

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Time</h3>
<p>As discussed in <a href="/m54765">Physical Quantities and Units</a>, the most
fundamental physical quantities are defined by how they are measured.
This is the case with time. Every measurement of time involves measuring
a change in some physical quantity. It may be a number on a digital
clock, a heartbeat, or the position of the Sun in the sky. In physics,
the definition of time is simple—<span id="import-auto-id2588516" data-type="term">time</span> is <em>change</em>, or the interval over which change occurs.
It is impossible to know that time has passed unless something changes.</p>
<p>The amount of time or change is calibrated by comparison with a
standard. The SI unit for time is the second, abbreviated s. We might,
for example, observe that a certain pendulum makes one full swing every
0.75 s. We could then use the pendulum to measure time by counting its
swings or, of course, by connecting the pendulum to a clock mechanism
that registers time on a dial. This allows us to not only measure the
amount of time, but also to determine a sequence of events.</p>
<p>How does time relate to motion? We are usually interested in elapsed
time for a particular motion, such as how long it takes an airplane
passenger to get from his seat to the back of the plane. To find elapsed
time, we note the time at the beginning and end of the motion and
subtract the two. For example, a lecture may start at 11:00
<span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span> and end at 11:50 <span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span>, so that the
elapsed time would be 50 min. <span id="import-auto-id4083152" data-type="term">Elapsed time</span> <strong><span class="math inline">\({\Delta t}{}\)</span></strong> is the difference between the
ending time and beginning time,</p>
<div id="import-auto-id1757927" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta t = {t_{f} - t_{0}},\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\({\Delta t}{}\)</span> is the change in time or elapsed time, <span class="math inline">\(t_{f}{}\)</span> is
the time at the end of the motion, and <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}{}\)</span> is the time at the
beginning of the motion. (As usual, the delta symbol, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta{}\)</span>, means
the change in the quantity that follows it.)</p>
<p>Life is simpler if the beginning time <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}{}\)</span> is taken to be zero, as
when we use a stopwatch. If we were using a stopwatch, it would simply
read zero at the start of the lecture and 50 min at the end. If
<span class="math inline">\(t_{0} = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\({\Delta t = t_{f}} \equiv t\)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> Velocity</h3>
<p>Your notion of velocity is probably the same as its scientific
definition. You know that if you have a large displacement in a small
amount of time you have a large velocity, and that velocity has units of
distance divided by time, such as miles per hour or kilometers per hour.</p>

<p><span id="import-auto-id2596035" data-type="term">Average velocity</span> is

<div id="import-auto-id4059844" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}} = \frac{x_{f} - x_{0}}{t_{f} - t_{0}}},}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\overset{-}{v}{}\)</span> is the <em>average</em> (indicated by the bar over the
<span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span>) velocity, <span class="math inline">\({\Delta x}{}\)</span> is the change in position (or

time <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> is taken to be zero, then the average velocity is simply</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2027122" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{t}}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice that this definition indicates that <em>velocity is a vector because
displacement is a vector</em>. It has both magnitude and direction. The SI
unit for velocity is meters per second or m/s, but many other units,
such as km/h, mi/h (also written as mph), and cm/s, are in common use.
Suppose, for example, an airplane passenger took 5 seconds to move −4 m
(the minus sign indicates that displacement is toward the back of the
plane). His average velocity would be</p>
<div id="import-auto-id4051374" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{t}} = \frac{- 4\ \text{m}}{5\ \text{s}}} = - \text{0.8\ m/s.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The minus sign indicates the average velocity is also toward the rear of
the plane.</p>
<p>The average velocity of an object does not tell us anything about what
happens to it between the starting point and ending point, however. For
example, we cannot tell from average velocity whether the airplane
passenger stops momentarily or backs up before he goes to the back of
the plane. To get more details, we must consider smaller segments of the
trip over smaller time intervals.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_02_02_01.jpg" id="import-auto-id1782958" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the
back of the plane, showing smaller segments of his
trip.</p>
</div>
<p>The smaller the time intervals considered in a motion, the more detailed
the information. When we carry this process to its logical conclusion,
we are left with an infinitesimally small interval. Over such an
interval, the average velocity becomes the <em>instantaneous velocity</em>
<em><!-- no-selfclose --></em>or the <em>velocity at a specific instant</em>.
A car's speedometer, for example, shows the magnitude (but not the
direction) of the instantaneous velocity of the car. (Police give
tickets based on instantaneous velocity, but when calculating how long
it will take to get from one place to another on a road trip, you need
to use average velocity.) <span id="import-auto-id2579029" data-type="term">Instantaneous
velocity</span> <span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span> is the average
velocity at a specific instant in time (or over an infinitesimally small
time interval).</p>
<p>Mathematically, finding instantaneous velocity, <span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span>, at a precise
instant <span class="math inline">\(t{}\)</span> can involve taking a limit, a calculus operation beyond
the scope of this text. However, under many circumstances, we can find
precise values for instantaneous velocity without calculus.</p>

<div id="fs-id3597726" depth="1">
<div id="speed" class="section level3" number="2.4.4" data-type="title">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> Speed</h3>
<p>In everyday language, most people use the terms “speed” and “velocity”
interchangeably. In physics, however, they do not have the same meaning
and they are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has
no direction. Thus <em>speed is a scalar</em>. Just as we need to distinguish
between instantaneous velocity and average velocity, we also need to
distinguish between instantaneous speed and average speed.</p>
<p><span id="import-auto-id2004213" data-type="term">Instantaneous speed</span> is the
magnitude of instantaneous velocity. For example, suppose the airplane
passenger at one instant had an instantaneous velocity of −3.0 m/s (the
minus meaning toward the rear of the plane). At that same time his
instantaneous speed was 3.0 m/s. Or suppose that at one time during a
shopping trip your instantaneous velocity is 40 km/h due north. Your
instantaneous speed at that instant would be 40 km/h—the same
magnitude but without a direction. Average speed, however, is very
different from average velocity. <span id="import-auto-id2004216" data-type="term">Average speed</span> is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time.</p>
<p>We have noted that distance traveled can be greater than displacement.
So average speed can be greater than average velocity, which is
displacement divided by time. For example, if you drive to a store and
return home in half an hour, and your car's odometer shows the total
distance traveled was 6 km, then your average speed was 12 km/h. Your
average velocity, however, was zero, because your displacement for the
round trip is zero. (Displacement is change in position and, thus, is
zero for a round trip.) Thus average speed is <em>not</em> simply the magnitude
of average velocity.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_02_02_02.jpg" id="import-auto-id2593426" alt="" />
<p class="caption">During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance
traveled is 6 km. The average speed is 12 km/h. The displacement for the
round trip is zero, since there was no net change in position. Thus the
average velocity is
zero.</p>
</div>
<p>Another way of visualizing the motion of an object is to use a graph. A
plot of position or of velocity as a function of time can be very
useful. For example, for this trip to the store, the position, velocity,
and speed-vs.-time graphs are displayed in
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id1806646" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. (Note that these
graphs depict a very simplified <span id="import-auto-id1510828" data-type="term">model</span> of the trip. We are assuming that speed is constant
during the trip, which is unrealistic given that we'll probably stop at
the store. But for simplicity's sake, we will model it with no stops or
changes in speed. We are also assuming that the route between the store
and the house is a perfectly straight line.)</p>

<p>In everyday conversation, to accelerate means to speed up. The
accelerator in a car can in fact cause it to speed up. The greater the
<span id="import-auto-id1298945" data-type="term">acceleration</span>, the greater the
change in velocity over a given time. The formal definition of
acceleration is consistent with these notions, but more inclusive.</p>

<p>Average Acceleration</p>
</div>
<p><span id="import-auto-id2580108" data-type="term">Average Acceleration</span> is <em>the
rate at which velocity changes</em>,</p>
<div id="import-auto-id4040806" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{\overset{-}{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}} = \frac{v_{f}{- v_{0}}}{t_{f} - t_{0}}},}{}\]</span></p>

<p>where <em><span class="math inline">\(\overset{-}{a}{}\)</span></em> is average acceleration, <em><span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span></em> is velocity,
and <em><span class="math inline">\(t{}\)</span></em> is time. (The bar over the <span class="math inline">\(a{}\)</span> means <em>average</em>
acceleration.)</p>
</div>
<p>Because acceleration is velocity in m/s divided by time in s, the SI
units for acceleration are <span class="math inline">\(\text{m/s}^{2}{}\)</span>, meters per second squared
or meters per second per second, which literally means by how many
meters per second the velocity changes every second.</p>
<p>Recall that velocity is a vector—it has both magnitude and direction.
This means that a change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or
speed), but it can also be a change in <em>direction</em>. For example, if a
car turns a corner at constant speed, it is accelerating because its
direction is changing. The quicker you turn, the greater the
acceleration. So there is an acceleration when velocity changes either
in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed) or in direction, or
both.</p>
<div id="fs-id3524141" class="note" data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label="">
<div data-type="title">
<p>Acceleration as a Vector</p>
</div>
<p>Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the <em>change</em> in
velocity, <span class="math inline">\({\Delta v}{}\)</span>. Since velocity is a vector, it can change
either in magnitude or in direction. Acceleration is therefore a change
in either speed or direction, or both.</p>
</div>
<p>Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the
<em>change</em> in velocity, it is not always in the direction of <em>motion</em>.
When an object's acceleration is in the same direction of its motion,
the object will speed up. However, when an object's acceleration is
opposite to the direction of its motion, the object will slow down.
Speeding up and slowing down should not be confused with a positive and
negative acceleration. The next two examples should help to make this
distinction clear.</p>

Car B is also moving with a positive velocity. However, because it is
slowing down while moving with a positive velocity, its acceleration is
considered negative. (This can be viewed in a mathematical manner as
well. If the car was originally moving with a velocity of +25 m/s, it is
finishing with a speed less than that, like +5 m/s. Because the change
in velocity is negative, the acceleration will be as well.)</p>

<p>Because the positive direction is considered to the right of the paper,

while moving in a negative direction, its acceleration is actually
positive. As in example B, this may be more easily understood in a
mathematical sense. The car is originally moving with a large negative
velocity (−25 m/s) but slows to a final velocity that is less negative
(−5 m/s). This change in velocity, from −25 m/s to −5 m/s, is actually a
positive change (
<span class="math inline">\(v_{f} - v_{i} = \operatorname{} - 5\text{~m/s~} - - 25\text{~m/s}\)</span> of
20 m/s. Because the change in velocity is positive, the acceleration

<p>To answer this question, think about the definitions of distance and
distance traveled, and how they are related to displacement. Distance
between two positions is defined to be the magnitude of displacement,
which was found in <a href="kinematics.html#fs-id1744930" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>.
Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between the
two positions. (See <a href="/m54769">Displacement</a>.) In the case of the subway
train shown in <a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id2590556" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>,
the distance traveled is the same as the distance between the initial
and final positions of the train.</p>

<p>1. The displacement for part (a) was +2.00 km. Therefore, the distance

<p>2. The displacement for part (b) was <span class="math inline">\(\text{−1.5\ km.}\)</span> Therefore, the

<p>This problem involves three steps. First we must determine the change in
velocity, then we must determine the change in time, and finally we use
these values to calculate the acceleration.</p>

<p>The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is

<p>The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This sign is
reasonable because the train initially has a positive velocity in this
problem, and a negative acceleration would oppose the motion. Again,
acceleration is in the same direction as the <em>change</em> in velocity, which

it has a direction opposite to the velocity.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.3</span> Sign and Direction</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing to note about these examples is the
signs of the answers. In our chosen coordinate system, plus means the
quantity is to the right and minus means it is to the left. This is easy
to imagine for displacement and velocity. But it is a little less
obvious for acceleration. Most people interpret negative acceleration as
the slowing of an object. This was not the case in
<a href="kinematics.html#fs-id4015260" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, where a positive
acceleration slowed a negative velocity. The crucial distinction was
that the acceleration was in the opposite direction from the velocity.
In fact, a negative acceleration will <em>increase</em> a negative velocity.
For example, the train moving to the left in
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id2412190" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> is sped up by an
acceleration to the left. In that case, both <span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a{}\)</span> are
negative. The plus and minus signs give the directions of the
accelerations. If acceleration has the same sign as the velocity, the
object is speeding up. If acceleration has the opposite sign as the
velocity, the object is slowing down.</p>

<p>We might know that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving
away from a stop sign, the greater the displacement in a given time. But
we have not developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and
displacement. In this section, we develop some convenient equations for
kinematic relationships, starting from the definitions of displacement,
velocity, and acceleration already covered.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.2</span> Notation: <em>t</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>v</em>, <em>a</em></h3>
<p>First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial
time to be zero, as if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great
simplification. Since elapsed time is <span class="math inline">\({\Delta t = {t_{f} - t_{0}}}{}\)</span>,
taking <span class="math inline">\({t_{0} = 0}{}\)</span> means that <span class="math inline">\({\Delta t = t_{f}}{}\)</span>, the final time
on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the
subscript 0 to denote initial values of position and velocity. That is,
<span class="math inline">\(x_{0}\)</span> <em>is the initial position</em> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{0}{}\)</span> <em>is the initial
velocity</em>. We put no subscripts on the final values. That is, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> <em>is
the final time</em>, <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span> <em>is the final position</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> <em>is the final
velocity</em>. This gives a simpler expression for elapsed time—now,
<span class="math inline">\({\Delta t = t}{}\)</span>. It also simplifies the expression for displacement,
which is now <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x = {x - x_{0}}\)</span>. Also, it simplifies the
expression for change in velocity, which is now
<span class="math inline">\({\Delta v = {v - v_{0}}}{}\)</span>. To summarize, using the simplified
notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2563693" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[\left. \begin{array}{lll}
{\Delta t} &amp; = &amp; t \\
{\Delta x} &amp; = &amp; {x - x_{0}} \\
{\Delta v} &amp; = &amp; {v - v_{0}} \\
\end{array} \right\}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <em>the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a
subscript denotes a final value</em> in whatever motion is under
consideration.</p>
<p>We now make the important assumption that <em>acceleration is constant</em>.
This assumption allows us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous
acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and
instantaneous accelerations are equal. That is,</p>
<div id="import-auto-id1819116" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{\overset{-}{a} = a} = \text{constant}},}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>so we use the symbol <span class="math inline">\(a{}\)</span> for acceleration at all times. Assuming
acceleration to be constant does not seriously limit the situations we
can study nor degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing,
acceleration <em>is</em> constant in a great number of situations. Furthermore,
in many other situations we can accurately describe motion by assuming a
constant acceleration equal to the average acceleration for that motion.
Finally, in motions where acceleration changes drastically, such as a
car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, the motion can
be considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant
acceleration.</p>

<p>Solving for Displacement (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>) and Final Position (<span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span>) from
Average Velocity when Acceleration (<span class="math inline">\(a{}\)</span>) is Constant</p>
</div>
<p>To get our first two new equations, we start with the definition of
average velocity:</p>
<div id="import-auto-id1782525" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>

<p>Substituting the simplified notation for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>
yields</p>
<div id="import-auto-id4145482" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{x - x_{0}}{t}}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Solving for <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span> yields</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2297251" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{x = {x_{0} + \overset{-}{v}}}t\text{,}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where the average velocity is</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2086556" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2}}\ (\text{constant}\ a)\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The equation <span class="math inline">\({\overset{-}{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2}}{}\)</span> reflects the
fact that, when acceleration is constant, <span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span> is just the simple
average of the initial and final velocities. For example, if you
steadily increase your velocity (that is, with constant acceleration)
from 30 to 60 km/h, then your average velocity during this steady
increase is 45 km/h. Using the equation
<span class="math inline">\({\overset{-}{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2}}{}\)</span> to check this, we see that</p>
<div id="import-auto-id4152098" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2}} = \frac{\text{30\ km/h} + \text{60\ km/h}}{2}} = \text{45\ km/h,}}{}\]</span></p>

<p>If we convert 402 m to miles, we find that the distance covered is very
close to one quarter of a mile, the standard distance for drag racing.

</div>
<p>1. Identify the known values. We know that <span class="math inline">\({v_{0} = 0}{}\)</span>, since the

<span class="math inline">\({{x - x_{0}} = \text{402\ m}}{}\)</span> (this was the answer in

<span class="math inline">\({{a = \text{26}}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>2. Plug the knowns into the equation

<p>In order to determine which equations are best to use, we need to list
all of the known values and identify exactly what we need to solve for.
We shall do this explicitly in the next several examples, using tables
to set them off.</p>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution for (a)</span></p>
</div>
<p>1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that
<span class="math inline">\({{v_{0} = \text{30}}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}}{}\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\({v = \text{0}}{}\)</span>;
<span class="math inline">\({{a = {- 7}}\text{.}\text{00}\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is negative
because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We take <span class="math inline">\(x_{0}{}\)</span> to
be 0. We are looking for displacement <span class="math inline">\({\Delta x}{}\)</span>, or
<span class="math inline">\({x - x_{0}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>2. Identify the equation that will help up solve the problem. The best
equation to use is</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2180580" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{v^{2} = {v_{0}^{2} + 2a}}\left( {x - x_{0}} \right)}.}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This equation is best because it includes only one unknown, <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span>. We
know the values of all the other variables in this equation. (There are
other equations that would allow us to solve for <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span>, but they require
us to know the stopping time, <span class="math inline">\(t{}\)</span>, which we do not know. We could use
them but it would entail additional calculations.)</p>
<p>3. Rearrange the equation to solve for <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span>.</p>
<div id="import-auto-id4179294" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[x - x_{0} = \frac{v^{2} - v_{0}^{2}}{2a}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>4. Enter known values.</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2293184" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{x - 0} = \frac{0^{2} - \left( {\text{30}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}} \right)^{2}}{2\left( {{- 7}\text{.}\text{00\ m/s}^{2}} \right)}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Thus,</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2293155" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{x = \text{64}}\text{.}\text{3\ m\ on\ dry\ concrete}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution for (b)</span></p>
</div>
<p>This part can be solved in exactly the same manner as Part A. The only
difference is that the deceleration is
<span class="math inline">\({{–5}\text{.}\text{00\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>. The result is</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2178635" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{x_{\text{wet}} = \text{90}}\text{.}\text{0\ m\ on\ wet\ concrete}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>

<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution for (c)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in
Parts A and B for dry and wet concrete. So to answer this question, we
need to calculate how far the car travels during the reaction time, and
then add that to the stopping time. It is reasonable to assume that the
velocity remains constant during the driver's reaction time.</p>
<p>1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that
<span class="math inline">\(\overset{-}{v} = \text{30.0\ m/s}\)</span>;
<span class="math inline">\(t_{\text{reaction}} = 0.500\,\text{s}\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(a_{\text{reaction}} = 0\)</span>. We
take <span class="math inline">\(x_{0 - \text{reaction}}\)</span> to be 0. We are looking for
<span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{reaction}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>2. Identify the best equation to use.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({{x = {x_{0} + \overset{-}{v}}}t}{}\)</span> works well because the only
unknown value is <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span>, which is what we want to solve for.</p>
<p>3. Plug in the knowns to solve the equation.</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2175306" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{x = {0 + \left( {\text{30}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}} \right)}}{\left( {0\text{.}\text{500\ s}} \right) = \text{15}}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}.}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This means the car travels 15.0 m while the driver reacts, making the
total displacements in the two cases of dry and wet concrete 15.0 m
greater than if he reacted instantly.</p>
<p>4. Add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement
when braking.</p>
<div id="import-auto-id1658817" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{x_{\text{braking}} + x_{\text{reaction}}} = x_{\text{total}}}{}\]</span></p>

<p>The displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a
fast-moving car. It should take longer to stop a car on wet rather than
dry pavement. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to
the displacements. But more important is the general approach to solving
problems. We identify the knowns and the quantities to be determined and
then find an appropriate equation. There is often more than one way to
solve a problem. The various parts of this example can in fact be solved
by other methods, but the solutions presented above are the shortest.</p>

we need to solve.</p>
<p>3. We will need to rearrange the equation to solve for <span class="math inline">\(t{}\)</span>. In this

<p>4. Simplify the equation. The units of meters (m) cancel because they

braking deceleration of a car doing a slow (and safe) stop. Recall that,

While traveling in a car, slowly apply the brakes as you come up to a

<p>Problem-solving skills are obviously essential to success in a
quantitative course in physics. More importantly, the ability to apply
broad physical principles, usually represented by equations, to specific
situations is a very powerful form of knowledge. It is much more
powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and
problem-solving abilities can be applied to new situations, whereas a
list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible
circumstance. Such analytical skills are useful both for solving
problems in this text and for applying physics in everyday and
professional life.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Problem-Solving Steps</h3>
<p>While there is no simple step-by-step method that works for every
problem, the following general procedures facilitate problem solving and
make it more meaningful. A certain amount of creativity and insight is
required as well.</p>
<div id="fs-id2092387" depth="2">
<div id="step-1" class="section level4" number="2.7.2.1" data-type="title">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2.1</span> Step 1</h4>
<p><em>Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are
involved</em>. It often helps to <em>draw a simple sketch</em> at the outset. You
will also need to decide which direction is positive and note that on
your sketch. Once you have identified the physical principles, it is
much easier to find and apply the equations representing those
principles. Although finding the correct equation is essential, keep in
mind that equations represent physical principles, laws of nature, and
relationships among physical quantities. Without a conceptual
understanding of a problem, a numerical solution is meaningless.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2.2</span> Step 2</h4>
<p><em>Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as
stated (identify the knowns)</em>. Many problems are stated very succinctly
and require some inspection to determine what is known. A sketch can
also be very useful at this point. Formally identifying the knowns is of
particular importance in applying physics to real-world situations.
Remember, “stopped” means velocity is zero, and we often can take
initial time and position as zero.</p>

help.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2.4</span> Step 4</h4>
<p><em>Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the
problem</em>. Your list of knowns and unknowns can help here. It is easiest
if you can find equations that contain only one unknown—that is, all
of the other variables are known, so you can easily solve for the
unknown. If the equation contains more than one unknown, then an
additional equation is needed to solve the problem. In some problems,
several unknowns must be determined to get at the one needed most. In
such problems it is especially important to keep physical principles in
mind to avoid going astray in a sea of equations. You may have to use
two (or more) different equations to get the final answer.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2.5</span> Step 5</h4>
<p><em>Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate
equation, and obtain numerical solutions complete with units</em>. This step
produces the numerical answer; it also provides a check on units that
can help you find errors. If the units of the answer are incorrect, then
an error has been made. However, be warned that correct units do not
guarantee that the numerical part of the answer is also correct.</p>

<div id="step-6" class="section level4" number="2.7.2.6" data-type="title">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2.6</span> Step 6</h4>
<p><em>Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?</em> This
final step is extremely important—the goal of physics is to accurately
describe nature. To see if the answer is reasonable, check both its
magnitude and its sign, in addition to its units. Your judgment will
improve as you solve more and more physics problems, and it will become
possible for you to make finer and finer judgments regarding whether
nature is adequately described by the answer to a problem. This step
brings the problem back to its conceptual meaning. If you can judge
whether the answer is reasonable, you have a deeper understanding of
physics than just being able to mechanically solve a problem.</p>
<p>When solving problems, we often perform these steps in different order,
and we also tend to do several steps simultaneously. There is no rigid
procedure that will work every time. Creativity and insight grow with
experience, and the basics of problem solving become almost automatic.
One way to get practice is to work out the text's examples for yourself
as you read. Another is to work as many end-of-section problems as
possible, starting with the easiest to build confidence and progressing
to the more difficult. Once you become involved in physics, you will see
it all around you, and you can begin to apply it to situations you
encounter outside the classroom, just as is done in many of the
applications in this text.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3</span> Unreasonable Results</h3>
<p>Physics must describe nature accurately. Some problems have results that
are unreasonable because one premise is unreasonable or because certain
premises are inconsistent with one another. The physical principle
applied correctly then produces an unreasonable result. For example, if
a person starting a foot race accelerates at
<span class="math inline">\({0\text{.}\text{40\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> for 100 s, his final speed will be 40
m/s (about 150 km/h)—clearly unreasonable because the time of 100 s is
an unreasonable premise. The physics is correct in a sense, but there is
more to describing nature than just manipulating equations correctly.
Checking the result of a problem to see if it is reasonable does more
than help uncover errors in problem solving—it also builds intuition
in judging whether nature is being accurately described.</p>
<p>Use the following strategies to determine whether an answer is
reasonable and, if it is not, to determine what is the cause.</p>

<p><em>Solve the problem using strategies as outlined and in the format
followed in the worked examples in the text</em>. In the example given in
the preceding paragraph, you would identify the givens as the
acceleration and time and use the equation below to find the unknown
final velocity. That is,</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3.2</span> Step 2</h4>
<p><em>Check to see if the answer is reasonable</em>. Is it too large or too
small, or does it have the wrong sign, improper units, …? In this
case, you may need to convert meters per second into a more familiar
unit, such as miles per hour.</p>
<div id="import-auto-id1437508" data-type="equation">

<p><em>If the answer is unreasonable, look for what specifically could cause
the identified difficulty</em>. In the example of the runner, there are only
two assumptions that are suspect. The acceleration could be too great or
the time too long. First look at the acceleration and think about what
the number means. If someone accelerates at
<span class="math inline">\({0\text{.}\text{40\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>, their velocity is increasing by 0.4
m/s each second. Does this seem reasonable? If so, the time must be too
long. It is not possible for someone to accelerate at a constant rate of
<span class="math inline">\({0\text{.}\text{40\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> for 100 s (almost two minutes).</p>

<p>Falling objects form an interesting class of motion problems. For
example, we can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping
a rock into it and listening for the rock to hit the bottom. By applying
the kinematics developed so far to falling objects, we can examine some
interesting situations and learn much about gravity in the process.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.2</span> Gravity</h3>
<p>The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that,
if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location
all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the <em>same constant
acceleration</em>, <em>independent of their mass</em>. This experimentally
determined fact is unexpected, because we are so accustomed to the
effects of air resistance and friction that we expect light objects to
fall slower than heavy ones.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_02_07_00a.jpg" id="import-auto-id4126662" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A hammer and a feather will fall with the same constant acceleration
if air resistance is considered negligible. This is a general
characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R.
Scott demonstrated on the Moon in 1971, where the acceleration due to
gravity is only
<span class="math inline">\({1\text{.}\text{67\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall
slower than a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball will reach
the ground after a hard baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be
difficult to observe the difference if the height is not large.) Air
resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, while
friction between objects—such as between clothes and a laundry chute
or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped—also opposes
motion between them. For the ideal situations of these first few
chapters, an object <em>falling without air resistance or friction</em> is
defined to be in <span id="import-auto-id1714641" data-type="term">free-fall</span>.</p>
<p>The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth.
The acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore called the
<span id="import-auto-id1707599" data-type="term">acceleration due to gravity</span>.
The acceleration due to gravity is <em>constant</em>, which means we can apply
the kinematics equations to any falling object where air resistance and
friction are negligible. This opens a broad class of interesting
situations to us. The acceleration due to gravity is so important that
its magnitude is given its own symbol, <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>. It is constant at any
given location on Earth and has the average value</p>
<div id="eip-636" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{g = 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}\text{.}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Although <span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span> varies from <span class="math inline">\({9\text{.}\text{78\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\({9\text{.}\text{83\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>, depending on latitude, altitude,
underlying geological formations, and local topography, the average
value of <span class="math inline">\({9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span> will be used in this text
unless otherwise specified. The direction of the acceleration due to
gravity is <em>downward (towards the center of Earth)</em>. In fact, its
direction <em>defines</em> what we call vertical. Note that whether the
acceleration <span class="math inline">\(a{}\)</span> in the kinematic equations has the value <span class="math inline">\({+ g}{}\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\({- g}{}\)</span> depends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define
the upward direction as positive, then
<span class="math inline">\({{{a = {- g}} = {- 9}}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>, and if we define
the downward direction as positive, then
<span class="math inline">\({{{a = g} = 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.3</span> One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity</h3>
<p>The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to
start with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex
ones. So we start by considering straight up and down motion with no air
resistance or friction. These assumptions mean that the velocity (if
there is any) is vertical. If the object is dropped, we know the initial
velocity is zero. Once the object has left contact with whatever held or
threw it, the object is in free-fall. Under these circumstances, the
motion is one-dimensional and has constant acceleration of magnitude
<span class="math inline">\(g{}\)</span>. We will also represent vertical displacement with the symbol
<span class="math inline">\(y{}\)</span> and use <span class="math inline">\(x{}\)</span> for horizontal displacement.</p>

<p>Calculating Position and Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown
Upward</p>
</div>
<p>A person standing on the edge of a high cliff throws a rock straight up
with an initial velocity of 13.0 m/s. The rock misses the edge of the
cliff as it falls back to Earth. Calculate the position and velocity of
the rock 1.00 s, 2.00 s, and 3.00 s after it is thrown, neglecting the
effects of air resistance.</p>

<p>We are asked to determine the position <span class="math inline">\(y{}\)</span> at various times. It is
reasonable to take the initial position <span class="math inline">\(y_{0}{}\)</span> to be zero. This
problem involves one-dimensional motion in the vertical direction. We
use plus and minus signs to indicate direction, with up being positive
and down negative. Since up is positive, and the rock is thrown upward,
the initial velocity must be positive too. The acceleration due to
gravity is downward, so <span class="math inline">\(a{}\)</span> is negative. It is crucial that the
initial velocity and the acceleration due to gravity have opposite
signs. Opposite signs indicate that the acceleration due to gravity
opposes the initial motion and will slow and eventually reverse it.</p>
<p>Since we are asked for values of position and velocity at three times,
we will refer to these as <span class="math inline">\(y_{1}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{1}{}\)</span>; <em><span class="math inline">\(y_{2}{}\)</span></em> and

velocity changes linearly with time and that acceleration is constant.
<em>Misconception Alert!</em> Notice that the position vs. time graph shows
vertical position only. It is easy to get the impression that the graph
shows some horizontal motion—the shape of the graph looks like the
path of a projectile. But this is not the case; the horizontal axis is
<em>time</em>, not space. The actual path of the rock in space is straight up,
and straight down.</p>

<p>The interpretation of these results is important. At 1.00 s the rock is
above its starting point and heading upward, since <span class="math inline">\(y_{1}{}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(v_{1}{}\)</span> are both positive. At 2.00 s, the rock is still above its
starting point, but the negative velocity means it is moving downward.
At 3.00 s, both <span class="math inline">\(y_{3}{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{3}{}\)</span> are negative, meaning the rock
is below its starting point and continuing to move downward. Notice that
when the rock is at its highest point (at 1.5 s), its velocity is zero,
but its acceleration is still <span class="math inline">\({{- 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>. Its
acceleration is
<span class="math inline">\({{- 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}\)</span><sup><!-- no-selfclose --></sup>
for the whole trip—while it is moving up and while it is moving down.
Note that the values for <span class="math inline">\(y{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em> are the
positions (or displacements) of the rock, not the total distances
traveled. Finally, note that free-fall applies to upward motion as well
as downward. Both have the same acceleration—the acceleration due to
gravity, which remains constant the entire time. Astronauts training in
the famous Vomit Comet, for example, experience free-fall while arcing
up as well as down, as we will discuss in more detail later.</p>

<p>Calculating Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Down</p>

<p>What happens if the person on the cliff throws the rock straight down,
instead of straight up? To explore this question, calculate the velocity
of the rock when it is 5.10 m below the starting point, and has been
thrown downward with an initial speed of 13.0 m/s.</p>

<p>Since up is positive, the final position of the rock will be negative
because it finishes below the starting point at <span class="math inline">\({y_{0} = 0}{}\)</span>.
Similarly, the initial velocity is downward and therefore negative, as
is the acceleration due to gravity. We expect the final velocity to be
negative since the rock will continue to move downward.</p>
<div class="tinysection">
<p><span data-type="title">Solution</span></p>
</div>
<p>1. Identify the knowns. <span class="math inline">\(y_{0} = 0\)</span>;
<span class="math inline">\({y_{1}{= - 5}}\text{.}\text{10\ m}\)</span>;
<span class="math inline">\(v_{0} = {- \text{13}}\text{.0\ m/s}\)</span>;
<span class="math inline">\({{{a = {- g}} = {- 9}}\text{.}\text{80\ m}\text{/s}^{2}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>2. Choose the kinematic equation that makes it easiest to solve the
problem. The equation <span class="math inline">\({{v^{2} = {v_{0}^{2} + 2a}}({y - y_{0}})}{}\)</span>
works well because the only unknown in it is <span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span>. (We will plug
<span class="math inline">\(y_{1}{}\)</span> in for <span class="math inline">\(y{}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>3. Enter the known values</p>
<div id="import-auto-id2025017" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{v^{2} = {\left( {{- \text{13}}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}} \right)^{2} + 2}}\left( {{- 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}} \right){\left( {{- 5}\text{.}{\text{10\ m} - \text{0\ m}}} \right) = \text{268}}\text{.}\text{96\ m}^{2}\text{/s}^{2}},}{}\]</span></p>

<p><span class="math display">\[{{{v = {\pm \text{16}}}\text{.4\ m/s}}.}{}\]</span></p>

<p>The negative root is chosen to indicate that the rock is still heading

<p>Note that <em>this is exactly the same velocity the rock had at this
position when it was thrown straight upward with the same initial
speed</em>. (See <a href="kinematics.html#fs-id4067058" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> and
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id4173440" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a).) This is not
a coincidental result. Because we only consider the acceleration due to
gravity in this problem, the <em>speed</em> of a falling object depends only on
its initial speed and its vertical position relative to the starting
point. For example, if the velocity of the rock is calculated at a
height of 8.10 m above the starting point (using the method from
<a href="kinematics.html#fs-id4067058" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>) when the initial velocity
is 13.0 m/s straight up, a result of <span class="math inline">\({{\pm 3}\text{.}\text{20\ m/s}}{}\)</span>
is obtained. Here both signs are meaningful; the positive value occurs
when the rock is at 8.10 m and heading up, and the negative value occurs
when the rock is at 8.10 m and heading back down. It has the same
<em>speed</em> but the opposite direction.</p>

distance below the point of release, the rock has the same velocity in
both cases.</p>
</div>
<p>Another way to look at it is this: In
<a href="kinematics.html#fs-id4067058" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>, the rock is thrown up
with an initial velocity of <span class="math inline">\({\text{13}\text{.0\ m/s}}{}\)</span>. It rises and
then falls back down. When its position is <span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span> on its way back down,
its velocity is <span class="math inline">\({{- \text{13}}\text{.0\ m/s}}{}\)</span>. That is, it has the
same speed on its way down as on its way up. We would then expect its
velocity at a position of <span class="math inline">\({{y = {- 5}}\text{.}\text{10\ m}}{}\)</span> to be
the same whether we have thrown it upwards at
<span class="math inline">\({+ \text{13}}\text{.0\ m/s}\)</span> or thrown it downwards at
<span class="math inline">\({- \text{13}}\text{.0\ m/s}\)</span>. The velocity of the rock on its way down
from <span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span> is the same whether we have thrown it up or down to start
with, as long as the speed with which it was initially thrown is the
same.</p>

<p>Find <em>g</em> from Data on a Falling Object</p>

<p>The acceleration due to gravity on Earth differs slightly from place to
place, depending on topography (e.g., whether you are on a hill or in a
valley) and subsurface geology (whether there is dense rock like iron
ore as opposed to light rock like salt beneath you.) The precise
acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from data taken in an
introductory physics laboratory course. An object, usually a metal ball
for which air resistance is negligible, is dropped and the time it takes
to fall a known distance is measured. See, for example,
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id4097254" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. Very precise
results can be produced with this method if sufficient care is taken in

<p>Applying the Science Practices: Finding Acceleration Due to Gravity</p>
</div>
<p>While it is well established that the acceleration due to gravity is
quite nearly 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> at all locations on Earth, you can verify this
for yourself with some basic materials.</p>
<p>Your task is to find the acceleration due to gravity at your location.
Achieving an acceleration of precisely 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> will be difficult.
However, with good preparation and attention to detail, you should be
able to get close. Before you begin working, consider the following
questions.</p>
<p><em>What measurements will you need to take in order to find the
acceleration due to gravity?</em></p>
<p><em>What relationships and equations found in this chapter may be useful in
calculating the acceleration?</em></p>
<p><em>What variables will you need to hold constant?</em></p>
<p><em>What materials will you use to record your measurements?</em></p>
<p>Upon completing these four questions, record your procedure. Once
recorded, you may carry out the experiment. If you find that your
experiment cannot be carried out, you may revise your procedure.</p>
<p>Once you have found your experimental acceleration, compare it to the
assumed value of 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. If error exists, what were the likely
sources of this error? How could you change your procedure in order to
improve the accuracy of your findings?</p>

<p>The graph of position versus time in
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id3596921" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a) is a curve
rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve becomes steeper as
time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The
slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous
velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line tangent
to the curve at the point of interest and taking the slope of this
straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points in
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id3596921" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(a). If this is
done at every point on the curve and the values are plotted against
time, then the graph of velocity versus time shown in
<a href="kinematics.html#import-auto-id3596921" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>(b) is obtained.
Furthermore, the slope of the graph of velocity versus time is
acceleration, which is shown in

<p>The slope of a curve at a point is equal to the slope of a straight line
tangent to the curve at that point. This principle is illustrated in

point at <span class="math inline">\({t = \text{25\ s}}{}\)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>1. Find the tangent line to the curve at <span class="math inline">\({t = \text{25\ s}}{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>2. Determine the endpoints of the tangent. These correspond to a
position of 1300 m at time 19 s and a position of 3120 m at time 32 s.</p>
<p>3. Plug these endpoints into the equation to solve for the slope,
<em><span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span></em>.</p>
<div id="import-auto-id3627758" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\text{slope} = v_{Q}} = \frac{{\Delta x}_{Q}}{{\Delta t}_{Q}}} = \frac{\left( {\text{3120\ m} - \text{1300\ m}} \right)}{\left( {\text{32\ s} - \text{19\ s}} \right)}\]</span></p>

<p>Carrying this one step further, we note that the slope of a velocity

<p>Since the velocity versus time graph in

constant. Acceleration versus time is graphed in

<p>Additional general information can be obtained from

<p>A general relationship for velocity, acceleration, and time has again
been obtained from a graph. Notice that this equation was also derived
algebraically from other motion equations in <a href="/m54773">Motion Equations for
Constant Acceleration in One Dimension</a>.</p>
<p>It is not accidental that the same equations are obtained by graphical
analysis as by algebraic techniques. In fact, an important way to
<em>discover</em> physical relationships is to measure various physical
quantities and then make graphs of one quantity against another to see
if they are correlated in any way. Correlations imply physical
relationships and might be shown by smooth graphs such as those above.
From such graphs, mathematical relationships can sometimes be
postulated. Further experiments are then performed to determine the
validity of the hypothesized relationships.</p>

<p>A graph of position versus time can be used to generate a graph of
velocity versus time, and a graph of velocity versus time can be used to
generate a graph of acceleration versus time. We do this by finding the
slope of the graphs at every point. If the graph is linear (i.e., a line
with a constant slope), it is easy to find the slope at any point and
you have the slope for every point. Graphical analysis of motion can be
used to describe both specific and general characteristics of
kinematics. Graphs can also be used for other topics in physics. An
important aspect of exploring physical relationships is to graph them
and look for underlying relationships.</p>

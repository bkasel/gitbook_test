<p><!-- Chapter Outline 5.1.    Friction 5.2.    Drag Forces 5.3.    Elasticity: Stress and Strain --></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why it is difficult to walk on a smooth surface
like ice? The interaction between you and the surface is a result of
forces that affect your motion. In the previous chapter, you learned
Newton's laws of motion and examined how net force affects the motion,
position and shape of an object. Now we will look at some interesting
and common forces that will provide further applications of Newton's
laws of motion.</p>
<p>The information presented in this chapter supports learning objectives
covered under Big Idea 3 of the AP Physics Curriculum Framework, which
refer to the nature of forces and their roles in interactions among
objects. The chapter discusses examples of specific contact forces, such
as friction, air or liquid drag, and elasticity that may affect the
motion or shape of an object. It also discusses the nature of forces on
both macroscopic and microscopic levels (Enduring Understanding 3.C and
Essential Knowledge 3.C.4). In addition, Newton's laws are applied to
describe the motion of an object (Enduring Understanding 3.B) and to
examine relationships between contact forces and other forces exerted on
an object (Enduring Understanding 3.A, 3.A.3 and Essential Knowledge
3.A.4). The examples in this chapter give you practice in using vector
properties of forces (Essential Knowledge 3.A.2) and free-body diagrams
(Essential Knowledge 3.B.2) to determine net force (Essential Knowledge
3.B.1).</p>
<p><strong>Big Idea 3</strong> The interactions of an object with other objects can be
described by forces.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.A All forces share certain common
characteristics when considered by observers in inertial reference
frames.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.A.2 Forces are described by vectors.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.A.3 A force exerted on an object is always due to
the interaction of that object with another object.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.A.4 If one object exerts a force on a second
object, the second object always exerts a force of equal magnitude on
the ﬁrst object in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.B Classically, the acceleration of an object
interacting with other objects can be predicted by using
<span class="math inline">\(\overset{\rightarrow}{a} = \frac{\sum\overset{\rightarrow}{F}}{m}\)</span> .</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.B.1 If an object of interest interacts with
several other objects, the net force is the vector sum of the individual
forces.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.B.2 Free-body diagrams are useful tools for
visualizing forces being exerted on a single object and writing the
equations that represent a physical situation.</p>
<p>Enduring Understanding 3.C At the macroscopic level, forces can be
categorized as either long-range (action-at-a-distance) forces or
contact forces.</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge 3.C.4 Contact forces result from the interaction of
one object touching another object, and they arise from interatomic
electric forces. These forces include tension, friction, normal, spring
(Physics 1), and buoyant (Physics 2).</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the general characteristics of friction.</li>
<li>Describe the various types of friction.</li>
<li>Calculate the magnitudes of static and kinetic frictional forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information presented in this section supports the following AP®
learning objectives and science practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3.C.4.1</strong> The student is able to make claims about various contact
forces between objects based on the microscopic cause of those
forces. <strong>(S.P. 6.1)</strong></li>
<li><strong>3.C.4.2</strong> The student is able to explain contact forces (tension,
friction, normal, buoyant, spring) as arising from interatomic
electric forces and that they therefore have certain directions.
<strong>(S.P. 6.2)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><span id="import-auto-id1165298484489" data-type="term">Friction</span> is a force
that is around us all the time that opposes relative motion between
systems in contact but also allows us to move (which you have discovered
if you have ever tried to walk on ice). While a common force, the
behavior of friction is actually very complicated and is still not
completely understood. We have to rely heavily on observations for
whatever understandings we can gain. However, we can still deal with its
more elementary general characteristics and understand the circumstances
in which it behaves.</p>
<div id="fs-id1737207" class="note" data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label="">
<div data-type="title">
<p>Friction</p>
</div>
<p>Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in
contact.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the simpler characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to
the contact surface between systems and always in a direction that
opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each
other. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another,
then the friction between them is called <span id="import-auto-id1165296294917" data-type="term">kinetic
friction</span>. For example,
friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice. But when objects are
stationary, <span id="import-auto-id1165298806829" data-type="term">static friction</span><strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> can act between
them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction
between the objects.</p>
<div id="fs-id1529028" class="note" data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label="">
<div data-type="title">
<p>Kinetic Friction</p>
</div>
<p>If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then
the friction between them is called kinetic friction.</p>
</div>
<p>Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete
floor—you may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at
all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do—it
increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. But
if you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and
starts to move. Once in motion it is easier to keep it in motion than it
was to get it started, indicating that the kinetic friction force is
less than the static friction force. If you add mass to the crate, say
by placing a box on top of it, you need to push even harder to get it
started and also to keep it moving. Furthermore, if you oiled the

<strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong>is a crude pictorial representation of
how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Close-up
inspection of these surfaces shows them to be rough. So when you push to
get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object
until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break
off the points, or do both. A considerable force can be resisted by
friction with no apparent motion. The harder the surfaces are pushed
together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force
is needed to move them. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces
between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explain the
dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. Adhesion varies
with substances in contact and is a complicated aspect of surface
physics. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact
(fewer molecules adhering), so less force is required to keep the object
moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of
speed.</p>

<p class="caption">Frictional forces, such as <span class="math inline">\(f{}\)</span>, always oppose motion or attempted
motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because of
the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view.
In order for the object to move, it must rise to where the peaks can
skip along the bottom surface. Thus a force is required just to set the
object in motion. Some of the peaks will be broken off, also requiring a
force to maintain motion. Much of the friction is actually due to
attractive forces between molecules making up the two objects, so that
even perfectly smooth surfaces are not friction-free. Such adhesive
forces also depend on the substances the surfaces are made of,
explaining, for example, why rubber-soled shoes slip less than those
with leather
soles.</p>

<p>The equations given earlier <strong><!-- no-selfclose --></strong>include
the dependence of friction on materials and the normal force. The
direction of friction is always opposite that of motion, parallel to the
surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal force. For
example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the
floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its
weight,
<span class="math inline">\({{{W = {mg}} = (}\text{100\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80}\ \text{m/s}^{2}) = \text{980\ N}}{}\)</span>,
perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is
0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than
<span class="math inline">\({{f_{\text{s}(\text{max})} = \mu_{\text{s}}}{N =}\left( 0.45 \right){(\text{980}}{\ \text{N}) = \text{440}}\ \text{N}}\ {}\)</span>to
move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the
coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only
290 N
(<span class="math inline">\({{f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}}}{N = \left( {0\text{.}\text{30}} \right)}{\left( {\text{980}\ \text{N}} \right) = \text{290}}\ \text{N}}{}\)</span>)
would keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor is lubricated,
both coefficients are considerably less than they would be without
lubrication. Coefficient of friction is a unit less quantity with a
magnitude usually between 0 and 1.0. The coefficient of the friction
depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.</p>

<p>Many people have experienced the slipperiness of walking on ice.
However, many parts of the body, especially the joints, have much
smaller coefficients of friction—often three or four times less than
ice. A joint is formed by the ends of two bones, which are connected by
thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by the lower leg bone (the
tibia) and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a ball (at the end of
the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The ends of the bones
in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth, almost
glassy surface. The joints also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that
reduces friction and wear. A damaged or arthritic joint can be replaced
by an artificial joint
(<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165296217318" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>). These
replacements can be made of metals (stainless steel or titanium) or
plastic (polyethylene), also with very small coefficients of friction.</p>

<p>Other natural lubricants include saliva produced in our mouths to aid in
the swallowing process, and the slippery mucus found between organs in
the body, allowing them to move freely past each other during
heartbeats, during breathing, and when a person moves. Artificial
lubricants are also common in hospitals and doctor's clinics. For
example, when ultrasonic imaging is carried out, the gel that couples
the transducer to the skin also serves to lubricate the surface between
the transducer and the skin—thereby reducing the coefficient of
friction between the two surfaces. This allows the transducer to mover
freely over the skin.</p>

<p>Making Connections: Submicroscopic Explanations of Friction</p>
</div>
<p>The simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic
(large-scale) characteristics. Great strides have been made in the
atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades.
Researchers are finding that the atomic nature of friction seems to have
several fundamental characteristics. These characteristics not only
explain some of the simpler aspects of friction—they also hold the
potential for the development of nearly friction-free environments that
could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which is currently
being converted (unnecessarily) to heat.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165298530900" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> illustrates
one macroscopic characteristic of friction that is explained by
microscopic (small-scale) research. We have noted that friction is
proportional to the normal force, but not to the area in contact, a
somewhat counterintuitive notion. When two rough surfaces are in
contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction of the total area
since only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the
actual contact area increases, and it is found that the friction is
proportional to this area.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Figure_06_01_04a.jpg" id="import-auto-id1165298530900" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Two rough surfaces in contact have a much smaller area of actual
contact than their total area. When there is a greater normal force as a
result of a greater applied force, the area of actual contact increases
as does
friction.</p>
</div>
<p>But the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler
features of friction. The mechanism for how heat is generated is now
being determined. In other words, why do surfaces get warmer when
rubbed? Essentially, atoms are linked with one another to form lattices.
When surfaces rub, the surface atoms adhere and cause atomic lattices to
vibrate—essentially creating sound waves that penetrate the material.
The sound waves diminish with distance and their energy is converted
into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional wear can
also occur between atoms and molecules on the surfaces.
<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165298744656" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> shows how
the tip of a probe drawn across another material is deformed by
atomic-scale friction. The force needed to drag the tip can be measured
and is found to be related to shear stress, which will be discussed
later in this chapter. The variation in shear stress is remarkable (more
than a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\text{10}^{\text{12}}{}\)</span> ) and difficult to predict
theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a fundamental understanding
of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient times—friction.</p>

<p>Another interesting force in everyday life is the force of drag on an
object when it is moving in a fluid (either a gas or a liquid). You feel
the drag force when you move your hand through water. You might also
feel it if you move your hand during a strong wind. The faster you move
your hand, the harder it is to move. You feel a smaller drag force when
you tilt your hand so only the side goes through the air—you have
decreased the area of your hand that faces the direction of motion. Like
friction, the <span id="import-auto-id1165298930276" data-type="term">drag force</span> always opposes the motion of an object. Unlike simple
friction, the drag force is proportional to some function of the
velocity of the object in that fluid. This functionality is complicated
and depends upon the shape of the object, its size, its velocity, and
the fluid it is in. For most large objects such as bicyclists, cars, and
baseballs not moving too slowly, the magnitude of the drag force
<span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{D}}{}\)</span> is found to be proportional to the square of the speed
of the object. We can write this relationship mathematically as
<em><span class="math inline">\({F_{\text{D}} \propto \, v^{2}}{}\)</span></em>. When taking into account other
factors, this relationship becomes</p>
<div id="eip-871" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{D}} =}\frac{1}{2}C\rho\text{Av}^{2}}{}\text{,}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(C{}\)</span> is the drag coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(A{}\)</span> is the area of the object
facing the fluid, and <span class="math inline">\(\rho{}\)</span> is the density of the fluid. (Recall that
density is mass per unit volume.) This equation can also be written in a
more generalized fashion as <span class="math inline">\({F_{\text{D}} = \text{bv}^{n}}{}\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(b{}\)</span><em><!-- no-selfclose --></em> is a constant equivalent to
<span class="math inline">\({0\text{.5}{C\rho A}}{}\)</span>. We have set the exponent for these equations
as 2 because, when an object is moving at high velocity through air, the
magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square of the speed.
As we shall see in a few pages on fluid dynamics, for small particles
moving at low speeds in a fluid, the exponent is equal to 1.</p>

<p>The drag coefficient can depend upon velocity, but we will assume that
it is a constant here.
<a href="#import-auto-id1165298535568" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> lists some
typical drag coefficients for a variety of objects. Notice that the drag
coefficient is a dimensionless quantity. At highway speeds, over 50% of
the power of a car is used to overcome air drag. The most fuel-efficient
cruising speed is about 70–80 km/h (about 45–50 mi/h). For this
reason, during the 1970s oil crisis in the United States, maximum speeds
on highways were set at about 90 km/h (55 mi/h).</p>

<p>Substantial research is under way in the sporting world to minimize
drag. The dimples on golf balls are being redesigned as are the clothes
that athletes wear. Bicycle racers and some swimmers and runners wear
full bodysuits. Australian Cathy Freeman wore a full body suit in the
2000 Sydney Olympics, and won the gold medal for the 400 m race. Many
swimmers in the 2008 Beijing Olympics wore (Speedo) body suits; it might
have made a difference in breaking many world records (See
<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165298678773" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>). Most
elite swimmers (and cyclists) shave their body hair. Such innovations
can have the effect of slicing away milliseconds in a race, sometimes
making the difference between a gold and a silver medal. One consequence
is that careful and precise guidelines must be continuously developed to
maintain the integrity of the sport.</p>

</div>
<p>Some interesting situations connected to Newton's second law occur when
considering the effects of drag forces upon a moving object. For
instance, consider a skydiver falling through air under the influence of
gravity. The two forces acting on him are the force of gravity and the
drag force (ignoring the buoyant force). The downward force of gravity
remains constant regardless of the velocity at which the person is
moving. However, as the person's velocity increases, the magnitude of
the drag force increases until the magnitude of the drag force is equal
to the gravitational force, thus producing a net force of zero. A zero
net force means that there is no acceleration, as given by Newton's
second law. At this point, the person's velocity remains constant and
we say that the person has reached his <em>terminal velocity</em> (<span class="math inline">\(v_{t}{}\)</span>).
Since <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{D}}{}\)</span> is proportional to the speed, a heavier skydiver
must go faster for <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{D}}{}\)</span> to equal his weight. Let's see how
this works out more quantitatively.</p>
<p>At the terminal velocity,</p>
<div id="eip-303" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{{F_{\text{net}} = {\text{mg} - F_{\text{D}}}} = \text{ma}} = 0}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Thus,</p>
<div id="eip-38" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\text{mg} = F_{\text{D}}}\text{.}}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Using the equation for drag force, we have</p>
<div id="eip-19" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{\text{mg} = \frac{1}{2}}\rho\text{CAv}^{2}}.}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Solving for the velocity, we obtain</p>
<div id="eip-545" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{v = \sqrt{\frac{2\text{mg}}{\rho\text{CA}}}}.}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Assume the density of air is
<span class="math inline">\({{\rho = 1}\text{.}\text{21\ kg}\text{/m}^{3}}{}\)</span>. A 75-kg skydiver
descending head first will have an area approximately
<span class="math inline">\({{A = 0}\text{.}\text{18}\ \text{m}^{2}}{}\)</span> and a drag coefficient of
approximately <span class="math inline">\({{C = 0}\text{.}\text{70}}{}\)</span>. We find that</p>
<div id="eip-981" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{lll}
v &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{\frac{2(\text{75\ kg})(9\text{.80\ m}\text{/s}^{2})}{(1\text{.}\text{21\ kg}\text{/m}^{3})(0\text{.}\text{70})(\text{0.18}\ \text{m}^{2})}} \\
 &amp; = &amp; \text{98\ m/s} \\
 &amp; = &amp; {\text{350\ km/h}\text{.}} \\
\end{array}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This means a skydiver with a mass of 75 kg achieves a maximum terminal
velocity of about 350 km/h while traveling in a pike (head first)
position, minimizing the area and his drag. In a spread-eagle position,
that terminal velocity may decrease to about 200 km/h as the area
increases. This terminal velocity becomes much smaller after the
parachute opens.</p>

<p>This interesting activity examines the effect of weight upon terminal

their original shape, measure the time it takes for one, two, three,
four, and five nested filters to fall to the floor from the same height
(roughly 2 m). (Note that, due to the way the filters are nested, drag
is constant and only mass varies.) They obtain terminal velocity quite
quickly, so find this velocity as a function of mass. Plot the terminal
velocity <em><span class="math inline">\(v{}\)</span></em> versus mass. Also plot <em><span class="math inline">\(v^{2}{}\)</span></em> versus mass. Which

<p>This result is consistent with the value for <span class="math inline">\(v_{\text{t}}{}\)</span> mentioned
earlier. The 75-kg skydiver going feet first had a
<span class="math inline">\({v = \text{98\ m}/\text{s}}{}\)</span>. He weighed less but had a smaller
frontal area and so a smaller drag due to the air.</p>
</div>
<p>The size of the object that is falling through air presents another
interesting application of air drag. If you fall from a 5-m high branch
of a tree, you will likely get hurt—possibly fracturing a bone.
However, a small squirrel does this all the time, without getting hurt.
You don't reach a terminal velocity in such a short distance, but the
squirrel does.</p>
<p>The following interesting quote on animal size and terminal velocity is
from a 1928 essay by a British biologist, J.B.S. Haldane, titled “On
Being the Right Size.”</p>
<p><em>To the mouse and any smaller animal, <span class="math display">\[gravity\]</span> presents practically
no dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and,
on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away,
provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is
broken, and a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement
by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide
an animal's length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is
reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the
resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten
times greater than the driving force.</em></p>
<p>The above quadratic dependence of air drag upon velocity does not hold
if the object is very small, is going very slow, or is in a denser
medium than air. Then we find that the drag force is proportional just
to the velocity. This relationship is given by <span id="import-auto-id1165298672873" data-type="term">Stokes'
law</span>, which states that</p>
<div id="eip-798" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{F_{\text{s}} = 6{\pi r\eta v}},}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the radius of the object, <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is the viscosity of the
fluid, and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the object's velocity.</p>

fluid, and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the object's velocity.</p>
</div>
<p>Good examples of this law are provided by microorganisms, pollen, and
dust particles. Because each of these objects is so small, we find that
many of these objects travel unaided only at a constant (terminal)
velocity. Terminal velocities for bacteria (size about <span class="math inline">\(\text{1\ μm}\)</span>)
can be about <span class="math inline">\(\text{2\ μm/s}\)</span>. To move at a greater speed, many bacteria
swim using flagella (organelles shaped like little tails) that are
powered by little motors embedded in the cell. Sediment in a lake can
move at a greater terminal velocity (about <span class="math inline">\(\text{5\ μm/s}\)</span>), so it can
take days to reach the bottom of the lake after being deposited on the
surface.</p>
<p>If we compare animals living on land with those in water, you can see
how drag has influenced evolution. Fishes, dolphins, and even massive
whales are streamlined in shape to reduce drag forces. Birds are
streamlined and migratory species that fly large distances often have
particular features such as long necks. Flocks of birds fly in the shape
of a spear head as the flock forms a streamlined pattern (see
<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165298645387" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>). In
humans, one important example of streamlining is the shape of sperm,
which need to be efficient in their use of energy.</p>

<p>Stokes' law describes sedimentation of particles in liquids and can be

velocity quickly. One can measure the time it takes for a particle to
fall a certain distance and then use Stokes' law to calculate the

<p>We now move from consideration of forces that affect the motion of an
object (such as friction and drag) to those that affect an object's
shape. If a bulldozer pushes a car into a wall, the car will not move
but it will noticeably change shape. A change in shape due to the
application of a force is a <span data-type="term">deformation</span>. Even very
small forces are known to cause some deformation. For small
deformations, two important characteristics are observed. First, the
object returns to its original shape when the force is removed—that
is, the deformation is elastic for small deformations. Second, the size
of the deformation is proportional to the force—that is, for small
deformations, Hooke's law is obeyed. In equation form, <span data-type="term">Hooke's

permanently deform the object until it finally fractures. The shape of

<p>The proportionality constant <span class="math inline">\(k{}\)</span> depends upon a number of factors for

the force applied (at least for small deformations). Thicker nylon
strings and ones made of steel stretch less for the same applied force,

<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165296232089" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>). Finally,
all three strings return to their normal lengths when the force is
removed, provided the deformation is small. Most materials will behave

<p>A change in length <span class="math inline">\({\Delta L}{}\)</span> is produced when a force is applied to
a wire or rod parallel to its length <span class="math inline">\(L_{0}{}\)</span>, either stretching it (a
tension) or compressing it. (See

<p class="caption">(a) Tension. The rod is stretched a length <span class="math inline">\({\Delta L}{}\)</span> when a force
is applied parallel to its length. (b) Compression. The same rod is
compressed by forces with the same magnitude in the opposite direction.
For very small deformations and uniform materials, <span class="math inline">\({\Delta L}{}\)</span> is
approximately the same for the same magnitude of tension or compression.
For larger deformations, the cross-sectional area changes as the rod is
compressed or
stretched.</p>
</div>
<p>Experiments have shown that the change in length (<span class="math inline">\({\Delta L}{}\)</span>)
depends on only a few variables. As already noted, <span class="math inline">\({\Delta L}{}\)</span> is
proportional to the force <span class="math inline">\(F{}\)</span> and depends on the substance from which
the object is made. Additionally, the change in length is proportional
to the original length <span class="math inline">\(L_{0}{}\)</span> and inversely proportional to the
cross-sectional area of the wire or rod. For example, a long guitar
string will stretch more than a short one, and a thick string will
stretch less than a thin one. We can combine all these factors into one
equation for <span class="math inline">\({\Delta L}{}\)</span>:</p>

<p>Bones, on the whole, do not fracture due to tension or compression.
Rather they generally fracture due to sideways impact or bending,
resulting in the bone shearing or snapping. The behavior of bones under
tension and compression is important because it determines the load the
bones can carry. Bones are classified as weight-bearing structures such
as columns in buildings and trees. Weight-bearing structures have
special features; columns in building have steel-reinforcing rods while
trees and bones are fibrous. The bones in different parts of the body
serve different structural functions and are prone to different
stresses. Thus the bone in the top of the femur is arranged in thin
sheets separated by marrow while in other places the bones can be
cylindrical and filled with marrow or just solid. Overweight people have
a tendency toward bone damage due to sustained compressions in bone
joints and tendons.</p>
<p>Another biological example of Hooke's law occurs in tendons.
Functionally, the tendon (the tissue connecting muscle to bone) must
stretch easily at first when a force is applied, but offer a much
greater restoring force for a greater strain.
<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165296334455" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> shows a
stress-strain relationship for a human tendon. Some tendons have a high
collagen content so there is relatively little strain, or length change;
others, like support tendons (as in the leg) can change length up to
10%. Note that this stress-strain curve is nonlinear, since the slope of
the line changes in different regions. In the first part of the stretch
called the toe region, the fibers in the tendon begin to align in the
direction of the stress—this is called <em>uncrimping</em>. In the linear
region, the fibrils will be stretched, and in the failure region
individual fibers begin to break. A simple model of this relationship
can be illustrated by springs in parallel: different springs are
activated at different lengths of stretch. Examples of this are given in
the problems at end of this chapter. Ligaments (tissue connecting bone
to bone) behave in a similar way.</p>

<p>Unlike bones and tendons, which need to be strong as well as elastic,
the arteries and lungs need to be very stretchable. The elastic
properties of the arteries are essential for blood flow. The pressure in
the arteries increases and arterial walls stretch when the blood is
pumped out of the heart. When the aortic valve shuts, the pressure in
the arteries drops and the arterial walls relax to maintain the blood
flow. When you feel your pulse, you are feeling exactly this—the
elastic behavior of the arteries as the blood gushes through with each
pump of the heart. If the arteries were rigid, you would not feel a
pulse. The heart is also an organ with special elastic properties. The
lungs expand with muscular effort when we breathe in but relax freely
and elastically when we breathe out. Our skins are particularly elastic,
especially for the young. A young person can go from 100 kg to 60 kg
with no visible sag in their skins. The elasticity of all organs reduces
with age. Gradual physiological aging through reduction in elasticity
starts in the early 20s.</p>

<p>This small change in length seems reasonable, consistent with our
experience that bones are rigid. In fact, even the rather large forces
encountered during strenuous physical activity do not compress or bend
bones by large amounts. Although bone is rigid compared with fat or
muscle, several of the substances listed in
<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165298671576" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> have larger
values of Young's modulus <span class="math inline">\(Y{}\)</span>. In other words, they are more rigid
and have greater tensile strength.</p>

<p>Examination of the shear moduli in
<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165298671576" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> reveals
some telling patterns. For example, shear moduli are less than Young's
moduli for most materials. Bone is a remarkable exception. Its shear
modulus is not only greater than its Young's modulus, but it is as
large as that of steel. This is one reason that bones can be long and
relatively thin. Bones can support loads comparable to that of concrete
and steel. Most bone fractures are not caused by compression but by
excessive twisting and bending.</p>
<p>The spinal column (consisting of 26 vertebral segments separated by
discs) provides the main support for the head and upper part of the
body. The spinal column has normal curvature for stability, but this
curvature can be increased, leading to increased shearing forces on the
lower vertebrae. Discs are better at withstanding compressional forces
than shear forces. Because the spine is not vertical, the weight of the
upper body exerts some of both. Pregnant women and people that are
overweight (with large abdomens) need to move their shoulders back to
maintain balance, thereby increasing the curvature in their spine and so
increasing the shear component of the stress. An increased angle due to
more curvature increases the shear forces along the plane. These higher
shear forces increase the risk of back injury through ruptured discs.
The lumbosacral disc (the wedge shaped disc below the last vertebrae) is
particularly at risk because of its location.</p>
<p>The shear moduli for concrete and brick are very small; they are too
highly variable to be listed. Concrete used in buildings can withstand
compression, as in pillars and arches, but is very poor against shear,
as might be encountered in heavily loaded floors or during earthquakes.
Modern structures were made possible by the use of steel and
steel-reinforced concrete. Almost by definition, liquids and gases have
shear moduli near zero, because they flow in response to shearing
forces.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.4</span> Changes in Volume: Bulk Modulus</h3>
<p>An object will be compressed in all directions if inward forces are
applied evenly on all its surfaces as in
<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165296230954" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. It is
relatively easy to compress gases and extremely difficult to compress
liquids and solids. For example, air in a wine bottle is compressed when
it is corked. But if you try corking a brim-full bottle, you cannot
compress the wine—some must be removed if the cork is to be inserted.
The reason for these different compressibilities is that atoms and
molecules are separated by large empty spaces in gases but packed close
together in liquids and solids. To compress a gas, you must force its
atoms and molecules closer together. To compress liquids and solids, you
must actually compress their atoms and molecules, and very strong
electromagnetic forces in them oppose this compression.</p>

<p class="caption">An inward force on all surfaces compresses this cube. Its change in
volume is proportional to the force per unit area and its original

</div>
<p>We can describe the compression or volume deformation of an object with
an equation. First, we note that a force “applied evenly” is defined to
have the same stress, or ratio of force to area <span class="math inline">\(\frac{F}{A}{}\)</span> on all
surfaces. The deformation produced is a change in volume <span class="math inline">\({\Delta V}{}\)</span>,
which is found to behave very similarly to the shear, tension, and
compression previously discussed. (This is not surprising, since a
compression of the entire object is equivalent to compressing each of
its three dimensions.) The relationship of the change in volume to other
physical quantities is given by</p>
<div id="eip-63" data-type="equation">
<p><span class="math display">\[{{{\Delta V = \frac{1}{B}}\frac{F}{A}V_{0}},}{}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the bulk modulus (see
<a href="further-applications-of-newtons-laws-friction-drag-and-elasticity.html#import-auto-id1165298671576" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>), <span class="math inline">\(V_{0}{}\)</span>
is the original volume, and <em><span class="math inline">\(\frac{F}{A}{}\)</span></em> is the force per unit area
applied uniformly inward on all surfaces. Note that no bulk moduli are
given for gases.</p>
<p>What are some examples of bulk compression of solids and liquids? One
practical example is the manufacture of industrial-grade diamonds by
compressing carbon with an extremely large force per unit area. The
carbon atoms rearrange their crystalline structure into the more tightly
packed pattern of diamonds. In nature, a similar process occurs deep
underground, where extremely large forces result from the weight of
overlying material. Another natural source of large compressive forces
is the pressure created by the weight of water, especially in deep parts
of the oceans. Water exerts an inward force on all surfaces of a
submerged object, and even on the water itself. At great depths, water
is measurably compressed, as the following example illustrates.</p>

<p>Although measurable, this is not a significant decrease in volume
considering that the force per unit area is about 500 atmospheres (1
million pounds per square foot). Liquids and solids are extraordinarily
difficult to compress.</p>
</div>
<p>Conversely, very large forces are created by liquids and solids when
they try to expand but are constrained from doing so—which is
equivalent to compressing them to less than their normal volume. This
often occurs when a contained material warms up, since most materials
expand when their temperature increases. If the materials are tightly
constrained, they deform or break their container. Another very common
example occurs when water freezes. Water, unlike most materials, expands
when it freezes, and it can easily fracture a boulder, rupture a
biological cell, or crack an engine block that gets in its way.</p>
<p>Other types of deformations, such as torsion or twisting, behave
analogously to the tension, shear, and bulk deformations considered
here.</p>

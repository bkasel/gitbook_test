Forces are given many names, such as push, pull, thrust, lift, weight,
friction, and tension. Traditionally, forces have been grouped into
several categories and given names relating to their source, how they
are transmitted, or their effects. The most important of these
categories are discussed in this section, together with some interesting
applications. Further examples of forces are discussed later in this
text.

### Normal Force {#normal-force data-type="title"}

[Weight]{#import-auto-id1910210 data-type="term"} (also called force of
gravity) is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be
counteracted to keep an object from falling. You definitely notice that
you must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when
you hold it stationary, as illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id2672874){.autogenerated-content}(a). But how do
inanimate objects like a table support the weight of a mass placed on
them, such as shown in
[link](#import-auto-id2672874){.autogenerated-content}(b)? When the bag
of dog food is placed on the table, the table actually sags slightly
under the load. This would be noticeable if the load were placed on a
card table, but even rigid objects deform when a force is applied to
them. Unless the object is deformed beyond its limit, it will exert a
restoring force much like a deformed spring (or trampoline or diving
board). The greater the deformation, the greater the restoring force. So
when the load is placed on the table, the table sags until the restoring
force becomes as large as the weight of the load. At this point the net
external force on the load is zero. That is the situation when the load
is stationary on the table. The table sags quickly, and the sag is
slight so we do not notice it. But it is similar to the sagging of a
trampoline when you climb onto it.

![(a) The person holding the bag of dog food must supply an upward force
$\textbf{F}_{\text{hand}}{}$ equal in magnitude and opposite in
direction to the weight of the food $\textbf{w}{}$. (b) The card table
sags when the dog food is placed on it, much like a stiff trampoline.
Elastic restoring forces in the table grow as it sags until they supply
a force $\textbf{N}{}$ equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to
the weight of the
load.](images/Figure_04_05_01.jpg){#import-auto-id2672874}

We must conclude that whatever supports a load, be it animate or not,
must supply an upward force equal to the weight of the load, as we
assumed in a few of the previous examples. If the force supporting a
load is perpendicular to the surface of contact between the load and its
support, this force is defined to be a [normal
force]{#import-auto-id1254224
data-type="term"}**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** and here is given
the symbol $\textbf{N}{}$. (This is not the unit for force N.) The word
*normal`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* means perpendicular to a surface.
The normal force can be less than the object's weight if the object is
on an incline, as you will see in the next example.

Common Misconception: Normal Force (N) vs. Newton (N)
:::

In this section we have introduced the quantity normal force, which is
represented by the variable $\textbf{N}{}$. This should not be confused
with the symbol for the newton, which is also represented by the letter
N. These symbols are particularly important to distinguish because the
units of a normal force ($\textbf{N}{}$) happen to be newtons (N). For
example, the normal force $\textbf{N}{}$ that the floor exerts on a
chair might be ${\textbf{N} = \text{100\ N}}{}$. One important
difference is that normal force is a vector, while the newton is simply
a unit. Be careful not to confuse these letters in your calculations!
You will encounter more similarities among variables and units as you
proceed in physics. Another example of this is the quantity work ($W{}$)
and the unit watts (W).

Weight on an Incline, a Two-Dimensional Problem
:::

Consider the skier on a slope shown in
[link](#import-auto-id2149297){.autogenerated-content}. Her mass
including equipment is 60.0 kg. (a) What is her acceleration if friction
is negligible? (b) What is her acceleration if friction is known to be
45.0 N?

![Since motion and friction are parallel to the slope, it is most
convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system where one axis
is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to
left of skier). $\textbf{N}{}$ is perpendicular to the slope and **f**
is parallel to the slope, but $\textbf{w}{}$ has components along both
axes, namely $\textbf{w}_{\bot}{}$ and $\textbf{w}_{\parallel}{}$.
$\textbf{N}{}$**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** is equal in magnitude
to $\textbf{w}_{\bot}{}$, so that there is no motion perpendicular to
the slope, but $f{}$ is less than $w_{\parallel}{}$, so that there is a
downslope acceleration (along the parallel
axis).](images/Figure_04_05_02.jpg){#import-auto-id2149297}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

This is a two-dimensional problem, since the forces on the skier (the
system of interest) are not parallel. The approach we have used in
two-dimensional kinematics also works very well here. Choose a
convenient coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes,
creating *two* connected *one*-dimensional problems to solve. The most
convenient coordinate system for motion on an incline is one that has
one coordinate parallel to the slope and one perpendicular to the slope.
(Remember that motions along mutually perpendicular axes are
independent.) We use the symbols $\bot{}$ and $\parallel {}$ to
represent perpendicular and parallel, respectively. This choice of axes
simplifies this type of problem, because there is no motion
perpendicular to the slope and because friction is always parallel to
the surface between two objects. The only external forces acting on the
system are the skier's weight, friction, and the support of the slope,
respectively labeled $\textbf{w}{}$, $\textbf{f}{}$, and $\textbf{N}{}$
in [link](#import-auto-id2149297){.autogenerated-content}.
$\textbf{N}{}$**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** is always perpendicular
to the slope, and $\textbf{f}{}$**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** is
parallel to it. But $\textbf{w}{}$ is not in the direction of either
axis, and so the first step we take is to project it into components
along the chosen axes, defining $w_{\parallel}$ to be the component of
weight parallel to the slope and $w_{\bot}{}$ the component of weight
perpendicular to the slope. Once this is done, we can consider the two
separate problems of forces parallel to the slope and forces
perpendicular to the slope.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

The magnitude of the component of the weight parallel to the slope is
${{w_{\parallel} = \mathit{w}\ }\text{sin}\ (\text{25º}{) = {\mathit{mg}\ }}\text{sin}\ (\text{25º})}{}$,
and the magnitude of the component of the weight perpendicular to the
slope is
${{w_{\bot} = \mathit{w}\ }\text{cos}\ (\text{25º}{) = {\mathit{mg}\ }}\text{cos}\ (\text{25º})}{}$.

\(a\) Neglecting friction. Since the acceleration is parallel to the
slope, we need only consider forces parallel to the slope. (Forces
perpendicular to the slope add to zero, since there is no acceleration
in that direction.) The forces parallel to the slope are the amount of
the skier's weight parallel to the slope $w_{\parallel}{}$ and friction
$f{}$. Using Newton's second law, with subscripts to denote quantities
parallel to the slope,

::: {#eip-id2648920 data-type="equation"}
$$a_{\parallel} = \frac{F_{\text{net} \parallel}}{m}$$
:::

where
${{{F_{\text{net} \parallel} = w_{\parallel}} = \text{mg}\ }\text{sin}\ (\text{25º})}{}$,
assuming no friction for this part, so that

::: {#eip-id1172560 data-type="equation"}
$$a_{\parallel} = \frac{F_{\text{net} \parallel}}{m} = \frac{\text{mg}\ \text{sin}\ (\text{25º})}{m} = g\ \text{sin}\ (\text{25º})$$

is the acceleration.

\(b\) Including friction. We now have a given value for friction, and we
know its direction is parallel to the slope and it opposes motion
between surfaces in contact. So the net external force is now

::: {#eip-id1959204 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net} \parallel} = {w_{\parallel} - f}},$$
:::

and substituting this into Newton's second law,
${a_{\parallel} = \frac{F_{\text{net} \parallel}}{m}}{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*,
gives

::: {#eip-id1527388 data-type="equation"}
$${{{a_{\parallel} = \frac{F_{\text{net} \mid \mid}}{m}} = \frac{w_{\parallel} - f}{m}} = \frac{{\text{mg}\ }\text{sin}\ (\text{25º}{) - f}}{m}}.$$

We substitute known values to obtain

$${a_{\parallel} = \frac{(\text{60}\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2})(0\text{.}\text{4226}{) - \text{45}}\text{.}\text{0\ N}}{\text{60}\text{.}\text{0\ kg}}}\operatorname{},$$

which yields

$${{a_{\parallel} = 3}\text{.}\text{39\ m/s}^{2}},$$
:::

which is the acceleration parallel to the incline when there is 45.0 N
of opposing friction.

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

Since friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration
is smaller when there is friction than when there is none. In fact, it
is a general result that if friction on an incline is negligible, then
the acceleration down the incline is ${{a = g\ }\text{sin}\theta}{}$,
*regardless of mass*. This is related to the previously discussed fact
that all objects fall with the same acceleration in the absence of air
resistance. Similarly, all objects, regardless of mass, slide down a
frictionless incline with the same acceleration (if the angle is the
same).

Resolving Weight into Components
:::

[\
]{data-type="newline"}

![An object rests on an incline that makes an angle θ with the
horizontal.](images/Figure_04_05_03.jpg){#import-auto-id1795220}

When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle $\theta{}$ with
the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided
into two components: a force acting perpendicular to the plane,
$\textbf{w}_{\bot}{}$**,`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** and a force
acting parallel to the plane, $\textbf{w}_{\parallel}{}$. The
perpendicular force of weight,
$\textbf{w}_{\bot}{}$**,`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** is typically
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal force,
$\textbf{N}{}$. The force acting parallel to the plane,
$\textbf{w}_{\parallel}{}$, causes the object to accelerate down the
incline. The force of friction, $\mathbf{f}{}$, opposes the motion of
the object, so it acts upward along the plane.

It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object
into components. If the angle of the incline is at an angle $\theta{}$
to the horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are

::: {#eip-id2265769 data-type="equation"}
$${{w_{\parallel} = w\ }\text{sin}\ (\theta{) = {\text{mg}\ }}\text{sin}\ (\theta)}{}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-id1553388 data-type="equation"}
$${{w_{\bot} = w\ }\text{cos}\ (\theta{) = \text{mg}\ }\text{cos}\ (\theta)}.$$
:::

Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to
determine them from reason. To do this, draw the right triangle formed
by the three weight vectors. Notice that the angle $\theta{}$ of the
incline is the same as the angle formed between
$\textbf{w}{}$**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** and
$\textbf{w}_{\bot}{}$**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}**. Knowing this
property, you can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of the
weight components:

::: {#eip-id2503179 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
{\text{cos}\ (\theta)} & = & \frac{w_{\bot}}{w} \\

Take-Home Experiment: Force Parallel
:::

To investigate how a force parallel to an inclined plane changes, find a
rubber band, some objects to hang from the end of the rubber band, and a
board you can position at different angles. How much does the rubber
band stretch when you hang the object from the end of the board? Now
place the board at an angle so that the object slides off when placed on
the board. How much does the rubber band extend if it is lined up
parallel to the board and used to hold the object stationary on the
board? Try two more angles. What does this show?

### Tension {#tension data-type="title"}

A [tension]{#import-auto-id1608257
data-type="term"}**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** is a force along the
length of a medium, especially a force carried by a flexible medium,
such as a rope or cable. The word "tension*"* comes from a Latin word
meaning "to stretch." Not coincidentally, the flexible cords that carry
muscle forces to other parts of the body are called *tendons*. Any
flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, wire, or cable, can
exert pulls only parallel to its length; thus, a force carried by a
flexible connector is a tension with direction parallel to the
connector. It is important to understand that tension is a pull in a
connector. In contrast, consider the phrase: "You can't push a rope."
The tension force pulls outward along the two ends of a rope.

Consider a person holding a mass on a rope as shown in
[link](#import-auto-id2715102){.autogenerated-content}.

![When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend
it) such as this rope transmits a force $\textbf{T}{}$, that force must
be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull such a
flexible connector exerts is a tension. Note that the rope pulls with
equal force but in opposite directions on the hand and the supported
mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). This is an example of Newton's
third law. The rope is the medium that carries the equal and opposite
forces between the two objects. The tension anywhere in the rope between
the hand and the mass is equal. Once you have determined the tension in
one location, you have determined the tension at all locations along the
rope.](images/Figure%2004_05_04.jpg){#import-auto-id2715102}

Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we
can prove using Newton's second law. If the 5.00-kg mass in the figure
is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, and thus
${\textbf{F}_{\text{net}} = 0}{}$. The only external forces acting on
the mass are its weight $\textbf{w}{}$**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}**
and the tension $\textbf{T}{}$ supplied by the rope. Thus,

::: {#eip-id2555725 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{net}} = {T - w}} = 0},$$
:::

where $T{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* and
$w{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* are the magnitudes of the tension
and weight and their signs indicate direction, with up being positive
here. Thus, just as you would expect, the tension equals the weight of
the supported mass:

::: {#eip-id1640254 data-type="equation"}
$${{T = w} = \text{mg}}.$$
:::

For a 5.00-kg mass, then (neglecting the mass of the rope) we see that

::: {#eip-id2489897 data-type="equation"}
$${{{T = \text{mg}} = (}\text{5.00\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}{) =}\text{49.0\ N}}.$$
:::

If we cut the rope and insert a spring, the spring would extend a length
corresponding to a force of 49.0 N, providing a direct observation and
measure of the tension force in the rope.

Flexible connectors are often used to transmit forces around corners,
such as in a hospital traction system, a finger joint, or a bicycle
brake cable. If there is no friction, the tension is transmitted
undiminished. Only its direction changes, and it is always parallel to
the flexible connector. This is illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id1318288){.autogenerated-content} (a) and (b).

![(a) Tendons in the finger carry force $\textbf{T}{}$ from the muscles
to other parts of the finger, usually changing the force's direction,
but not its magnitude (the tendons are relatively friction free). (b)
The brake cable on a bicycle carries the tension $\textbf{T}{}$ from the
handlebars to the brake mechanism. Again, the direction but not the
magnitude of $\textbf{T}{}$ is
changed.](images/Figure_04_05_05.jpg){#import-auto-id1318288}

What Is the Tension in a Tightrope?
:::

Calculate the tension in the wire supporting the 70.0-kg tightrope
walker shown in [link](#import-auto-id2091042){.autogenerated-content}.

![The weight of a tightrope walker causes a wire to sag by 5.0 degrees.
The system of interest here is the point in the wire at which the
tightrope walker is
standing.](images/Figure_04_05_06.jpg){#import-auto-id2091042}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

As you can see in the figure, the wire is not perfectly horizontal (it
cannot be!), but is bent under the person's weight. Thus, the tension on
either side of the person has an upward component that can support his
weight. As usual, forces are vectors represented pictorially by arrows
having the same directions as the forces and lengths proportional to
their magnitudes. The system is the tightrope walker, and the only
external forces acting on him are his weight $\textbf{w}{}$ and the two
tensions $\textbf{T}_{\text{L}}{}$ (left
~`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}~ tension) and $\textbf{T}_{\text{R}}{}$
(right tension), as illustrated. It is reasonable to neglect the weight
of the wire itself. The net external force is zero since the system is
stationary. A little trigonometry can now be used to find the tensions.
One conclusion is possible at the outset---we can see from part (b) of
the figure that the magnitudes of the tensions $T_{\text{L}}{}$ and
$T_{\text{R}}{}$ must be equal. This is because there is no horizontal
acceleration in the rope, and the only forces acting to the left and
right are $T_{\text{L}}{}$ and $T_{R}{}$. Thus, the magnitude of those
forces must be equal so that they cancel each other out.

Whenever we have two-dimensional vector problems in which no two vectors
are parallel, the easiest method of solution is to pick a convenient
coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes. In this case
the best coordinate system has one axis horizontal and the other
vertical. We call the horizontal the $x{}$-axis
*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* and the vertical the $y{}$-axis.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

First, we need to resolve the tension vectors into their horizontal and
vertical components. It helps to draw a new free-body diagram showing
all of the horizontal and vertical components of each force acting on
the system.

![When the vectors are projected onto vertical and horizontal axes,
their components along those axes must add to zero, since the tightrope
walker is stationary. The small angle results in $T{}$ being much
greater than $w{}$.](images/Figure_04_05_07.jpg){#import-auto-id1561864}

Consider the horizontal components of the forces (denoted with a
subscript $x{}$):

::: {#eip-id2592142 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}x} = {T_{\text{L}x} - T_{\text{R}x}}}.$$

The net external horizontal force ${F_{\text{net}x} = 0}{}$, since the

:::

Now, observe [link](#import-auto-id1561864){.autogenerated-content}. You
can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of $T_{\text{L}}{}$ and
$T_{\text{R}}{}$. Notice that:

::: {#eip-id2130931 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
{\text{cos}\ (5.0º)} & = & \frac{T_{\text{L}x}}{T_{\text{L}}} \\

{\text{cos}\ (5.0º)} & = & \frac{T_{\text{R}x}}{T_{\text{R}}} \\
T_{\text{R}x} & = & {T_{\text{R}}\ \text{cos}\ (5.0º).} \\
\end{array}$$
:::

Equating $T_{\text{L}x}{}$ and $T_{\text{R}x}{}$:

::: {#eip-id2382116 data-type="equation"}
$${T_{\text{L}}\ \text{cos}\ (5.0º{) = T_{\text{R}}}\ \text{cos}\ (5.0º)}.$$
:::

Thus,

::: {#eip-id2350456 data-type="equation"}
$${{T_{\text{L}} = T_{\text{R}}} = T},$$
:::

as predicted. Now, considering the vertical components (denoted by a
subscript $y{}$), we can solve for $T{}$. Again, since the person is
stationary, Newton's second law implies that net ${F_{y} = 0}{}$. Thus,
as illustrated in the free-body diagram in
[link](#import-auto-id1561864){.autogenerated-content},

::: {#eip-id1851063 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{net}y} = {{T_{\text{L}y} + T_{\text{R}y}} - w}} = 0}.$$
:::

Observing [link](#import-auto-id1561864){.autogenerated-content}, we can
use trigonometry to determine the relationship between
$T_{\text{L}y}{}$, $T_{\text{R}y}{}$, and $T{}$. As we determined from
the analysis in the horizontal direction,
${{T_{\text{L}} = T_{\text{R}}} = T}{}$:

::: {#eip-id3367015 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}

{\text{sin}\ (5.0º)} & = & \frac{T_{\text{R}y}}{T_{\text{R}}} \\
{T_{\text{R}y} = T_{\text{R}}\ \text{sin}\ (5.0º)} & = & {T\ \text{sin}\ (5.0º).} \\
\end{array}$$
:::

Now, we can substitute the values for $T_{\text{L}y}{}$ and
$T_{\text{R}y}{}$, into the net force equation in the vertical
direction:

::: {#eip-id2085200 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}

Note that the vertical tension in the wire acts as a normal force that
supports the weight of the tightrope
walker.**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** The tension is almost six
times the 686-N weight of the tightrope walker. Since the wire is nearly
horizontal, the vertical component of its tension is only a small
fraction of the tension in the wire. The large horizontal components are
in opposite directions and cancel, and so most of the tension in the
wire is not used to support the weight of the tightrope walker.
:::

If we wish to *create* a very large tension, all we have to do is exert
a force perpendicular to a flexible connector, as illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id2847184){.autogenerated-content}. As we saw in the
last example, the weight of the tightrope walker acted as a force
perpendicular to the rope. We saw that the tension in the roped related
to the weight of the tightrope walker in the following way:

::: {#eip-id2294185 data-type="equation"}
$${T = \frac{w}{2\ \text{sin}\ (\theta)}}.$$
:::

We can extend this expression to describe the tension $T{}$ created when
a perpendicular force ($\textbf{F}_{\bot}{}$) is exerted at the middle
of a flexible connector:

::: {#eip-id1535477 data-type="equation"}
$${T = \frac{F_{\bot}}{2\ \text{sin}\ (\theta)}}.$$
:::

Note that $\theta{}$ is the angle between the horizontal and the bent
connector. In this case, $T{}$ becomes very large as $\theta{}$
approaches zero. Even the relatively small weight of any flexible
connector will cause it to sag, since an infinite tension would result
if it were horizontal (i.e., ${\theta = 0}{}$ and
${\text{sin}{\ \theta = 0}}{}$). (See
[link](#import-auto-id2847184){.autogenerated-content}.)

![We can create a very large tension in the chain by pushing on it
perpendicular to its length, as shown. Suppose we wish to pull a car out
of the mud when no tow truck is available. Each time the car moves
forward, the chain is tightened to keep it as nearly straight as
possible. The tension in the chain is given by
${T = \frac{F_{\bot}}{2\ \text{sin}\ (\theta)}}{}$ ; since $\theta{}$ is
small, $T{}$ is very large. This situation is analogous to the tightrope
walker shown in [link](#import-auto-id2091042){.autogenerated-content},
except that the tensions shown here are those transmitted to the car and
the tree rather than those acting at the point where
$\textbf{F}_{\bot}{}$ is
applied.](images/Figure_04_05_08.jpg){#import-auto-id2847184}

![Unless an infinite tension is exerted, any flexible connector---such
as the chain at the bottom of the picture---will sag under its own
weight, giving a characteristic curve when the weight is evenly
distributed along the length. Suspension bridges---such as the Golden
Gate Bridge shown in this image---are essentially very heavy flexible
connectors. The weight of the bridge is evenly distributed along the
length of flexible connectors, usually cables, which take on the
characteristic shape. (credit: Leaflet, Wikimedia

### Extended Topic: Real Forces and Inertial Frames {#extended-topic-real-forces-and-inertial-frames data-type="title"}

There is another distinction among forces in addition to the types
already mentioned. Some forces are real, whereas others are not. *Real
forces***`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** are those that have some
physical origin, such as the gravitational pull. Contrastingly,
*fictitious forces* **`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}**are those that
arise simply because an observer is in an accelerating frame of
reference, such as one that rotates (like a merry-go-round) or undergoes
linear acceleration (like a car slowing down). For example, if a
satellite is heading due north above Earth's northern hemisphere, then
to an observer on Earth it will appear to experience a force to the west
that has no physical origin. Of course, what is happening here is that
Earth is rotating toward the east and moves east under the satellite. In
Earth's frame this looks like a westward force on the satellite, or it
can be interpreted as a violation of Newton's first law (the law of
inertia). An [inertial frame of reference]{#import-auto-id2695882
data-type="term"} is one in which all forces are real and, equivalently,
one in which Newton's laws have the simple forms given in this chapter.

Earth's rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame.
You ordinarily must perform precise experiments to observe fictitious
forces and the slight departures from Newton's laws, such as the effect
just described. On the large scale, such as for the rotation of weather
systems and ocean currents, the effects can be easily observed.

The crucial factor in determining whether a frame of reference is
inertial is whether it accelerates or rotates relative to a known
inertial frame. Unless stated otherwise, all phenomena discussed in this
text are considered in inertial frames.

All the forces discussed in this section are real forces, but there are
a number of other real forces, such as lift and thrust, that are not
discussed in this section. They are more specialized, and it is not
necessary to discuss every type of force. It is natural, however, to ask
where the basic simplicity we seek to find in physics is in the long
list of forces. Are some more basic than others? Are some different
manifestations of the same underlying force? The answer to both
questions is yes, as will be seen in the next (extended) section and in
the treatment of modern physics later in the text.

force of tension is in the cable?
:::

::: {#fs-id1678045 data-type="solution"}
The force of tension must equal the force of gravity plus the force
necessary to accelerate the mass. $F = mg$ can be used to calculate the
first, and $F = ma$ can be used to calculate the second.

For gravity:

$\begin{array}{l}
{F = mg} \\
{= (120.0\,\text{kg)(9}\text{.8}\,\text{m/s}^{\text{2}})} \\
{= 1205.4\,\text{N}} \\
\end{array}$

For acceleration:

$$\begin{array}{l}
{F = ma} \\
{= (120.0\,\text{kg)(1}\text{.3}\,\text{m/s}^{\text{2}})} \\
{= 159.9\,\text{N}} \\
\end{array}$$

The total force of tension in the cable is 1176 N + 156 N = 1332 N.

### Section Summary { data-type="title"}

-   When objects rest on a surface, the surface applies a force to the
    object that supports the weight of the object. This supporting force
    acts perpendicular to and away from the surface. It is called a
    normal force, $\textbf{N}{}$.
-   When objects rest on a non-accelerating horizontal surface, the
    magnitude of the normal force is equal to the weight of the object:
    ::: {#eip-id1331551 data-type="equation"}
    $${N = \text{mg}}.$$
    :::
-   When objects rest on an inclined plane that makes an angle
    $\theta{}$ with the horizontal surface, the weight of the object can
    be resolved into components that act perpendicular
    ($\textbf{w}_{\bot}{}$) and parallel
    ($\textbf{w}_{\parallel}{}$**)** to the surface of the plane. These
    components can be calculated using:
    ::: {#eip-id2419526 data-type="equation"}
    $${{w_{\parallel} = w\ }\text{sin}\ (\theta{) = \text{mg}}\ \text{sin}\ (\theta)}{}$$
    :::

    ::: {#eip-id1949783 data-type="equation"}
    $${{w_{\bot} = w}\ \text{cos}\ (\theta{) = {\text{mg}\ }}\text{cos}\ (\theta)}.$$
    :::
-   The pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector,
    such as a rope or cable, is called tension, $\textbf{T}{}$. When a
    rope supports the weight of an object that is at rest, the tension
    in the rope is equal to the weight of the object:
    ::: {#eip-id1166246 data-type="equation"}
    $${T = \text{mg}}.$$
    :::
-   In any inertial frame of reference (one that is not accelerated or
    rotated), Newton's laws have the simple forms given in this chapter
    and all forces are real forces having a physical origin.

[Dynamics]{#import-auto-id2134480 data-type="term"} is the study of the
forces that cause objects and systems to move. To understand this, we
need a working definition of force. Our intuitive definition of
[force]{#import-auto-id2712510 data-type="term"}---that is, a push or a
pull---is a good place to start. We know that a push or pull has both
magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity) and can
vary considerably in each regard. For example, a cannon exerts a strong
force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth
exerts only a tiny downward pull on a flea. Our everyday experiences
also give us a good idea of how multiple forces add. If two people push
in different directions on a third person, as illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id2379809){.autogenerated-content}, we might expect
the total force to be in the direction shown. Since force is a vector,
it adds just like other vectors, as illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id2379809){.autogenerated-content}(a) for two ice
skaters. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can
be added using the familiar head-to-tail method or by trigonometric
methods. These ideas were developed in [Two-Dimensional
Kinematics](/m54779).

By definition, force is always the result of an interaction of two or
more objects. No object possesses force on its own. For example, a
cannon does not possess force, but it can exert force on a cannonball.
Earth does not possess force on its own, but exerts force on a football
or on any other massive object. The skaters in [Figure
4.3](#import-auto-id2379809) exert force on one another as they
interact.

No object can exert force on itself. When you clap your hands, one hand
exerts force on the other. When a train accelerates, it exerts force on
the track and vice versa. A bowling ball is accelerated by the hand
throwing it; once the hand is no longer in contact with the bowling
ball, it is no longer accelerating the bowling ball or exerting force on
it. The ball continues moving forward due to inertia.

![Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third.
Forces are vectors and add like other vectors, so the total force on the
third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body
diagram representing the forces acting on the third
skater.](images/Figure%2004_01_01.jpg){#import-auto-id2379809}

[link](#import-auto-id2379809){.autogenerated-content}(b) is our first
example of a [free-body diagram]{#import-auto-id1590568
data-type="term"}, which is a technique used to illustrate all the
[external forces]{#import-auto-id1608860 data-type="term"} acting on a
body. The body is represented by a single isolated point (or free body),
and only those forces acting *on* the body from the outside (external
forces) are shown. (These forces are the only ones shown, because only
external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any
internal forces within the body.) Free-body diagrams are very useful in
analyzing forces acting on a system and are employed extensively in the
study and application of Newton's laws of motion.

A more quantitative definition of force can be based on some standard
force, just as distance is measured in units relative to a standard
distance. One possibility is to stretch a spring a certain fixed
distance, as illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id2608835){.autogenerated-content}, and use the
force it exerts to pull itself back to its relaxed shape---called a
*restoring force*---as a standard. The magnitude of all other forces can
be stated as multiples of this standard unit of force. Many other
possibilities exist for standard forces. (One that we will encounter in
[Magnetism](/m55373) is the magnetic force between two wires carrying
electric current.) Some alternative definitions of force will be given
later in this chapter.

![The force exerted by a stretched spring can be used as a standard unit
of force. (a) This spring has a length $x{}$ when undistorted. (b) When
stretched a distance ${\Delta x}{}$, the spring exerts a restoring
force, $\textbf{F}_{\text{restore}}{}$, which is reproducible. (c) A
spring scale is one device that uses a spring to measure force. The
force $\textbf{F}_{\text{restore}}{}$ is exerted on whatever is attached
to the hook. Here $\textbf{F}_{\text{restore}}{}$ has a magnitude of 6
units in the force standard being
employed.](images/Figure_04_01_02.jpg){#import-auto-id2608835}

Take-Home Experiment: Force Standards
:::

To investigate force standards and cause and effect, get two identical
rubber bands. Hang one rubber band vertically on a hook. Find a small
household item that could be attached to the rubber band using a paper
clip, and use this item as a weight to investigate the stretch of the
rubber band. Measure the amount of stretch produced in the rubber band
with one, two, and four of these (identical) items suspended from the
rubber band. What is the relationship between the number of items and
the amount of stretch? How large a stretch would you expect for the same
number of items suspended from two rubber bands? What happens to the
amount of stretch of the rubber band (with the weights attached) if the
weights are also pushed to the side with a pencil?

The figure above represents a racetrack with semicircular sections
connected by straight sections. Each section has length *d*, and markers
along the track are spaced *d*/4 apart. Two people drive cars
counterclockwise around the track, as shown. Car *X* goes around the
curves at constant speed *v*~c~, increases speed at constant
acceleration for half of each straight section to reach a maximum speed
of 2*v*~c~, then brakes at constant acceleration for the other half of
each straight section to return to speed *v*~c~. Car *Y* also goes
around the curves at constant speed *v*~c~, increases its speed at
constant acceleration for one-fourth of each straight section to reach
the same maximum speed 2*v*~c~, stays at that speed for half of each
straight section, then brakes at constant acceleration for the remaining
fourth of each straight section to return to speed *v*~c~.

\(a\) On the figures below, draw an arrow showing the direction of the
net force on each of the cars at the positions noted by the dots. If the
net force is zero at any position, label the dot with 0.

![](images/Figure_04_01_04.jpg){#fs-id1401005}

The position of the six dots on the Car Y track on the right are as
follows:

-   The first dot on the left center of the track is at the same
    position as it is on the Car X track.
-   The second dot is just slight to the right of the Car X dot (less
    than a dash) past three perpendicular hash marks moving to the
    right.
-   The third dot is about one and two-thirds perpendicular hash marks
    to the right of the center top perpendicular has mark.
-   The fourth dot is in the same position as the Car X figure (one
    perpendicular hash mark above the center right perpendicular hash
    mark).
-   The fifth dot is about one and two-third perpendicular hash marks to
    the right of the center bottom perpendicular hash mark.
-   The sixth dot is in the same position as the Car Y dot (one and two
    third perpendicular hash marks to the left of the center bottom hash
    mark).

i\. Indicate which car, if either, completes one trip around the track
in less time, and justify your answer qualitatively without using
equations.

ii\. Justify your answer about which car, if either, completes one trip
around the track in less time quantitatively with appropriate equations.

Car *X* is shown on the left, and Car *Y* is shown on the right.

i\.

Car *X* takes longer to accelerate and does not spend any time traveling
at top speed. Car *Y* accelerates over a shorter time and spends time
going at top speed. So Car *Y* must cover the straightaways in a shorter
time. Curves take the same time, so Car *Y* must overall take a shorter
time.

ii\.

The only difference in the calculations for the time of one segment of
linear acceleration is the difference in distances. That shows that Car
*X* takes longer to accelerate. The equation $\frac{d}{4v_{c}} = t_{c}$
corresponds to Car *Y* traveling for a time at top speed.

Substituting $a = \frac{v_{c}}{t_{1}}$ into the displacement equation in
part (b) ii gives $D = \frac{3}{2}v_{c}t_{1}$. This shows that a car
takes less time to reach its maximum speed when it accelerates over a
shorter distance. Therefore, Car *Y* reaches its maximum speed more
quickly, and spends more time at its maximum speed than Car *X* does, as
argued in part (b) i.

A hawk accelerates as it glides in the air. Does the force causing the
acceleration come from the hawk itself? Explain.
:::

::: {#fs-id1904859 data-type="solution"}
A body cannot exert a force on itself. The hawk may accelerate as a
result of several forces. The hawk may accelerate toward Earth as a
result of the force due to gravity. The hawk may accelerate as a result
of the additional force exerted on it by wind. The hawk may accelerate
as a result of orienting its body to create less air resistance, thus
increasing the net force forward.

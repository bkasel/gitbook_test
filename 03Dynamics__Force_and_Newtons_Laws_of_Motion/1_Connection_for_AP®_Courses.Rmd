Motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, causing us
to marvel at the forces needed to achieve spectacular motion, such as
that of a jumping dolphin, a leaping pole vaulter, a bird in flight, or
an orbiting satellite. The study of motion is kinematics, but kinematics
only *describes* the way objects move---their velocity and their
acceleration. [Dynamics]{#import-auto-id2665402
data-type="term"}**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** considers the forces
that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton's laws of
motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws provide an example of
the breadth and simplicity of principles under which nature functions.
They are also universal laws in that they apply to situations on Earth
as well as in space.

Isaac Newton's (1642--1727) laws of motion were just one part of the
monumental work that has made him legendary. The development of Newton's
laws marks the transition from the Renaissance into the modern era. This
transition was characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people
thought about the physical universe. For many centuries natural
philosophers had debated the nature of the universe based largely on
certain rules of logic, with great weight given to the thoughts of
earlier classical philosophers such as Aristotle (384--322 BC). Among
the many great thinkers who contributed to this change were Newton and
Galileo Galilei (1564--1647).

![Isaac Newton's monumental work, *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica*, was published in 1687. It proposed scientific laws that
are still used today to describe the motion of objects. (credit: Service

Galileo was instrumental in establishing *observation* as the absolute
determinant of truth, rather than "logical" argument. Galileo's use of
the telescope was his most notable achievement in demonstrating the
importance of observation. He discovered moons orbiting Jupiter and made
other observations that were inconsistent with certain ancient ideas and
religious dogma. For this reason, and because of the manner in which he
dealt with those in authority, Galileo was tried by the Inquisition and
punished. He spent the final years of his life under a form of house
arrest. Because others before Galileo had also made discoveries by
*observing* the nature of the universe and because repeated observations
verified those of Galileo, his work could not be suppressed or denied.
After his death, his work was verified by others, and his ideas were
eventually accepted by the church and scientific communities.

Galileo also contributed to the formulation of what is now called
Newton's first law of motion. Newton made use of the work of his
predecessors, which enabled him to develop laws of motion, discover the
law of gravity, invent calculus, and make great contributions to the
theories of light and color. It is amazing that many of these
developments were made by Newton working alone, without the benefit of
the usual interactions that take place among scientists today.

Newton's laws are introduced along with Big Idea 3, that interactions
can be described by forces. These laws provide a theoretical basis for
studying motion depending on interactions between the objects. In
particular, Newton\'s laws are applicable to all forces in inertial
frames of references (Enduring Understanding 3.A). We will find that all
forces are vectors; that is, forces always have both a magnitude and a
direction (Essential Knowledge 3.A.2). Furthermore, we will learn that
all forces are a result of interactions between two or more objects
(Essential Knowledge 3.A.3). These interactions between any two objects
are described by Newton\'s third law, stating that the forces exerted on
these objects are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to each
other (Essential Knowledge 3.A.4).

We will discover that there is an empirical cause-effect relationship
between the net force exerted on an object of mass *m* and its
acceleration, with this relationship described by Newton\'s second law
(Enduring Understanding 3.B). This supports Big Idea 1, that inertial
mass is a property of an object or a system. The mass of an object or a
system is one of the factors affecting changes in motion when an object
or a system interacts with other objects or systems (Essential Knowledge
1.C.1). Another is the net force on an object, which is the vector sum
of all the forces exerted on the object (Essential Knowledge 3.B.1). To
analyze this, we use free-body diagrams to visualize the forces exerted
on a given object in order to find the net force and analyze the
object\'s motion (Essential Knowledge 3.B.2).

Thinking of these objects as systems is a concept introduced in this
chapter, where a system is a collection of elements that could be
considered as a single object without any internal structure (Essential
Knowledge 5.A.1). This will support Big Idea 5, that changes that occur
to the system due to interactions are governed by conservation laws.
These conservation laws will be the focus of later chapters in this
book. They explain whether quantities are conserved in the given system
or change due to transfer to or from another system due to interactions
between the systems (Enduring Understanding 5.A).

Furthermore, when a situation involves more than one object, it is
important to define the system and analyze the motion of a whole system,
not its elements, based on analysis of external forces on the system.
This supports Big Idea 4, that interactions between systems cause
changes in those systems. All kinematics variables in this case describe
the motion of the center of mass of the system (Essential Knowledge
4.A.1, Essential Knowledge 4.A.2). The internal forces between the
elements of the system do not affect the velocity of the center of mass
(Essential Knowledge 4.A.3). The velocity of the center of mass will
change only if there is a net external force exerted on the system
(Enduring Understanding 4.A).

We will learn that some of these interactions can be explained by the
existence of fields extending through space, supporting Big Idea 2. For
example, any object that has mass creates a gravitational field in space
(Enduring Understanding 2.B). Any material object (one that has mass)
placed in the gravitational field will experience gravitational force
(Essential Knowledge 2.B.1).

Forces may be categorized as contact or long-distance (Enduring
Understanding 3.C). In this chapter we will work with both. An example
of a long-distance force is gravitation (Essential Knowledge 3.C.1).
Contact forces, such as tension, friction, normal force, and the force
of a spring, result from interatomic electric forces at the microscopic
level (Essential Knowledge 3.C.4).

It was not until the advent of modern physics early in the twentieth
century that it was discovered that Newton's laws of motion produce a
good approximation to motion only when the objects are moving at speeds
much, much less than the speed of light and when those objects are
larger than the size of most molecules (about 10^--9^ m in diameter).
These constraints define the realm of classical mechanics, as discussed
in [Introduction to the Nature of Science and Physics](/m54763). At the
beginning of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein (1879--1955)
developed the theory of relativity and, along with many other
scientists, quantum theory. Quantum theory does not have the constraints
present in classical physics. All of the situations we consider in this
chapter, and all those preceding the introduction of relativity in
**Special Relativity**, are in the realm of classical physics.

The development of special relativity and empirical observations at
atomic scales led to the idea that there are four basic forces that
account for all known phenomena. These forces are called fundamental
(Enduring Understanding 3.G). The properties of gravitational (Essential
Knowledge 3.G.1) and electromagnetic (Essential Knowledge 3.G.2) forces
are explained in more detail.

**Big Idea 1** Objects and systems have properties such as mass and
charge. Systems may have internal structure.

Essential Knowledge 1.C.1 Inertial mass is the property of an object or
a system that determines how its motion changes when it interacts with
other objects or systems.

**Big Idea 2** Fields existing in space can be used to explain
interactions.

Enduring Understanding 2.A A field associates a value of some physical
quantity with every point in space. Field models are useful for
describing interactions that occur at a distance (long-range forces) as
well as a variety of other physical phenomena.

Essential Knowledge 2.A.1 A vector field gives, as a function of
position (and perhaps time), the value of a physical quantity that is
described by a vector.

Essential Knowledge 2.A.2 A scalar field gives the value of a physical
quantity.

Enduring Understanding 2.B A gravitational field is caused by an object
with mass.

Essential Knowledge 2.B.1 A gravitational field *g* at the location of
an object with mass *m* causes a gravitational force of magnitude *mg*
to be exerted on the object in the direction of the field.

**Big Idea 3** The interactions of an object with other objects can be
described by forces.

Enduring Understanding 3.A All forces share certain common
characteristics when considered by observers in inertial reference
frames.

Essential Knowledge 3.A.2 Forces are described by vectors.

Essential Knowledge 3.A.3 A force exerted on an object is always due to
the interaction of that object with another object.

Essential Knowledge 3.A.4 If one object exerts a force on a second
object, the second object always exerts a force of equal magnitude on
the first object in the opposite direction.

Enduring Understanding 3.B Classically, the acceleration of an object
interacting with other objects can be predicted by using
$a = {\sum{F/m}}$.

Essential Knowledge 3.B.1 If an object of interest interacts with
several other objects, the net force is the vector sum of the individual
forces.

Essential Knowledge 3.B.2 Free-body diagrams are useful tools for
visualizing the forces being exerted on a single object and writing the
equations that represent a physical situation.

Enduring Understanding 3.C At the macroscopic level, forces can be
categorized as either long-range (action-at-a-distance) forces or
contact forces.

Essential Knowledge 3.C.1 Gravitational force describes the interaction
of one object that has mass with another object that has mass.

Essential Knowledge 3.C.4 Contact forces result from the interaction of
one object touching another object, and they arise from interatomic
electric forces. These forces include tension, friction, normal, spring
(Physics 1), and buoyant (Physics 2).

Enduring Understanding 3.G Certain types of forces are considered
fundamental.

Essential Knowledge 3.G.1 Gravitational forces are exerted at all scales
and dominate at the largest distance and mass scales.

Essential Knowledge 3.G.2 Electromagnetic forces are exerted at all
scales and can dominate at the human scale.

**Big Idea 4** Interactions between systems can result in changes in
those systems.

Enduring Understanding 4.A The acceleration of the center of mass of a
system is related to the net force exerted on the system, where
$a = {\sum{F/m}}$.

Essential Knowledge 4.A.1 The linear motion of a system can be described
by the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of its center of mass.

Essential Knowledge 4.A.2 The acceleration is equal to the rate of
change of velocity with time, and velocity is equal to the rate of
change of position with time.

Essential Knowledge 4.A.3 Forces that systems exert on each other are
due to interactions between objects in the systems. If the interacting
objects are parts of the same system, there will be no change in the
center-of-mass velocity of that system.

**Big Idea 5** Changes that occur as a result of interactions are
constrained by conservation laws.

Enduring Understanding 5.A Certain quantities are conserved, in the
sense that the changes of those quantities in a given system are always
equal to the transfer of that quantity to or from the system by all
possible interactions with other systems.

Essential Knowledge 5.A.1 A system is an object or a collection of
objects. The objects are treated as having no internal structure.

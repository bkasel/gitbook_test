:::

[Newton's second law of motion]{#import-auto-id765465 data-type="term"}
is closely related to Newton's first law of motion. It mathematically
states the cause and effect relationship between force and changes in
motion. Newton's second law of motion is more quantitative and is used
extensively to calculate what happens in situations involving a force.
Before we can write down Newton's second law as a simple equation giving
the exact relationship of force, mass, and acceleration, we need to
sharpen some ideas that have already been mentioned.

First, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a
change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity. A change in
velocity means, by definition, that there is an
[acceleration]{#import-auto-id3190786 data-type="term"}. Newton's first
law says that a net external force causes a change in motion; thus, we
see that a *net external force causes acceleration*.

Another question immediately arises. What do we mean by an external
force? An intuitive notion of external is correct---an [external
force]{#import-auto-id3026856 data-type="term"} acts from outside the
[system]{data-type="term"} of interest. For example, in
[link](#import-auto-id1993910){.autogenerated-content}(a) the system of
interest is the wagon plus the child in it. The two forces exerted by
the other children are external forces. An internal force acts between
elements of the system. Again looking at
[link](#import-auto-id1993910){.autogenerated-content}(a), the force the
child in the wagon exerts to hang onto the wagon is an internal force
between elements of the system of interest. Only external forces affect
the motion of a system, according to Newton's first law. (The internal
forces actually cancel, as we shall see in the next section.) *You must
define the boundaries of the system before you can determine which
forces are external*. Sometimes the system is obvious, whereas other
times identifying the boundaries of a system is more subtle. The concept
of a system is fundamental to many areas of physics, as is the correct
application of Newton's laws. This concept will be revisited many times
on our journey through physics.

When we describe the acceleration of a system, we are modeling the
system as a single point which contains all of the mass of that system.
The point we choose for this is the point about which the system's mass
is evenly distributed. For example, in a rigid object, this center of
mass is the point where the object will stay balanced even if only
supported at this point. For a sphere or disk made of homogenous
material, this point is of course at the center. Similarly, for a rod
made of homogenous material, the center of mass will be at the midpoint.

For the rider in the wagon in [Figure 4.5](#import-auto-id1993910), the
center of mass is probably between the rider's hips. Due to internal
forces, the rider's hand or hair may accelerate slightly differently,
but it is the acceleration of the system's center of mass that interests
us. This is true whether the system is a vehicle carrying passengers, a
bowl of grapes, or a planet. When we draw a free-body diagram of a
system, we represent the system's center of mass with a single point and
use vectors to indicate the forces exerted on that center of mass. (See
[Figure 4.5](#import-auto-id1993910).)

![Different forces exerted on the same mass produce different
accelerations. (a) Two children push a wagon with a child in it. Arrows
representing all external forces are shown. The system of interest is
the wagon and its rider. The weight $\textbf{w}{}$ of the system and the
support of the ground $\textbf{N}{}$ are also shown for completeness and
are assumed to cancel. The vector $\textbf{f}{}$ represents the friction
acting on the wagon, and it acts to the left, opposing the motion of the
wagon. (b) All of the external forces acting on the system add together
to produce a net force, $\textbf{F}_{\text{net}}{}$. The free-body
diagram shows all of the forces acting on the system of interest. The
dot represents the center of mass of the system. Each force vector
extends from this dot. Because there are two forces acting to the right,
we draw the vectors collinearly. (c) A larger net external force
produces a larger acceleration ($\textbf{a'} > \textbf{a}$) when an
adult pushes the
child.](images/Figure%2004_03_01.jpg){#import-auto-id1993910}

Now, it seems reasonable that acceleration should be directly
proportional to and in the same direction as the net (total) external
force acting on a system. This assumption has been verified
experimentally and is illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id1993910){.autogenerated-content}. In part (a), a
smaller force causes a smaller acceleration than the larger force
illustrated in part (c). For completeness, the vertical forces are also
shown; they are assumed to cancel since there is no acceleration in the
vertical direction. The vertical forces are the weight $\textbf{w}{}$
and the support of the ground $\textbf{N}{}$, and the horizontal force
$\textbf{f}{}$ represents the force of friction. These will be discussed
in more detail in later sections. For now, we will define
[friction]{#import-auto-id2639388 data-type="term"} as a force that
opposes the motion past each other of objects that are touching.
[link](#import-auto-id1993910){.autogenerated-content}(b) shows how
vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net
force, $\textbf{F}_{\text{net}}{}$.

To obtain an equation for Newton's second law, we first write the
relationship of acceleration and net external force as the
proportionality

::: {#eip-id1450972 data-type="equation"}
$${\textbf{a}{\propto}\textbf{F}_{\text{net}},}{}$$
:::

where the symbol $\propto$ means "proportional to," and
$\textbf{F}_{\text{net}}{}$ is the [net external
force]{#import-auto-id1890102 data-type="term"}. (The net external force
is the vector sum of all external forces and can be determined
graphically, using the head-to-tail method, or analytically, using
components. The techniques are the same as for the addition of other
vectors, and are covered in [Two-Dimensional Kinematics](/m54779).) This
proportionality states what we have said in words---*acceleration is
directly proportional to the net external force*. Once the system of
interest is chosen, it is important to identify the external forces and
ignore the internal ones. It is a tremendous simplification not to have
to consider the numerous internal forces acting between objects within
the system, such as muscular forces within the child's body, let alone
the myriad of forces between atoms in the objects, but by doing so, we
can easily solve some very complex problems with only minimal error due
to our simplification

Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely
proportional to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the
mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given
force. And indeed, as illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id1375143){.autogenerated-content}, the same net
external force applied to a car produces a much smaller acceleration
than when applied to a basketball. The proportionality is written as

::: {#eip-id1969451 data-type="equation"}
$${\textbf{a}{\propto}\frac{1}{m}}{}$$
:::

where $m{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* is the mass of the system.
Experiments have shown that acceleration is exactly inversely
proportional to mass, just as it is exactly linearly proportional to the
net external force.

![The same force exerted on systems of different masses produces
different accelerations. (a) A basketball player pushes on a basketball
to make a pass. (The effect of gravity on the ball is ignored.) (b) The
same player exerts an identical force on a stalled SUV and produces a
far smaller acceleration (even if friction is negligible). (c) The
free-body diagrams are identical, permitting direct comparison of the
two situations. A series of patterns for the free-body diagram will
emerge as you do more
problems.](images/Figure%2004_03_02.jpg){#import-auto-id1375143}

Both of these proportionalities have been experimentally verified
repeatedly and consistently, for a broad range of systems and scales.
Thus, it has been **experimentally** found that the acceleration of an
object depends *only* on the net external force and the mass of the
object. Combining the two proportionalities just given yields Newton\'s
second law of motion.

Applying the Science Practices: Testing the Relationship Between Mass,
Acceleration, and Force
:::

Plan three simple experiments using objects you have at home to test
relationships between mass, acceleration, and force.

\(a\) Design an experiment to test the relationship between mass and
acceleration. What will be the independent variable in your experiment?
What will be the dependent variable? What controls will you put in place
to ensure force is constant?

\(b\) Design a similar experiment to test the relationship between mass
and force. What will be the independent variable in your experiment?
What will be the dependent variable? What controls will you put in place
to ensure acceleration is constant?

\(c\) Design a similar experiment to test the relationship between force
and acceleration. What will be the independent variable in your
experiment? What will be the dependent variable? Will you have any
trouble ensuring that the mass is constant?

Newton's Second Law of Motion
:::

The acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and in the same
direction as the net external force acting on the system, and inversely
proportional to its mass.

In equation form, Newton's second law of motion is

::: {#eip-id1628753 data-type="equation"}
$${\textbf{a} = \frac{\textbf{F}_{\text{net}}}{m}}.$$
:::

This is often written in the more familiar form

::: {#eip-id2606927 data-type="equation"}
$${\textbf{F}_{\text{net}} = m\textbf{a}}.$$
:::

When only the magnitude of force and acceleration are considered, this
equation is simply

::: {#eip-id1641404 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}.{}$$
:::
:::

Although these last two equations are really the same, the first gives
more insight into what Newton's second law means. The law is a *cause
and effect relationship* among three quantities that is not simply based
on their definitions. The validity of the second law is completely based
on experimental verification.

### Units of Force {#units-of-force data-type="title"}

${\textbf{F}_{\text{net}} = m\textbf{a}}{}$ is used to define the units
of force in terms of the three basic units for mass, length, and time.
The SI unit of force is called the [newton]{#import-auto-id2929123
data-type="term"} (abbreviated N) and is the force needed to accelerate
a 1-kg system at the rate of ${1\text{m/s}^{2}}{}$. That is, since
${\textbf{F}_{\text{net}} = m\textbf{a}}{}$,

::: {#eip-id2390555 data-type="equation"}
$${\text{1\ N} = {\text{1\ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}^{2}}}.$$
:::

While almost the entire world uses the newton for the unit of force, in
the United States the most familiar unit of force is the pound (lb),
where 1 N = 0.225 lb.

### Weight and the Gravitational Force {#weight-and-the-gravitational-force data-type="title"}

When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth.
Newton's second law states that a net force on an object is responsible
for its acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on
a falling object is the gravitational force, commonly called its
[weight]{#import-auto-id3064229 data-type="term"} $\textbf{w}{}$. Weight
can be denoted as a vector $\textbf{w}{}$ because it has a direction;
*down* is, by definition, the direction of gravity, and hence weight is
a downward force. The magnitude of weight is denoted as $w{}$*.* Galileo
was instrumental in showing that, in the absence of air resistance, all
objects fall with the same acceleration $g{}$. Using Galileo's result
and Newton's second law, we can derive an equation for weight.

Consider an object with mass $m{}$ falling downward toward Earth. It
experiences only the downward force of gravity, which has magnitude
$w{}$. Newton's second law states that the magnitude of the net external
force on an object is ${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}{}$.

Since the object experiences only the downward force of gravity,
${F_{\text{net}} = w}{}$. We know that the acceleration of an object due
to gravity is $g{}$, or ${a = g}{}$. Substituting these into Newton's
second law gives

::: {#fs-id1276219 .note data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label=""}
::: {data-type="title"}
Weight
:::

This is the equation for *weight*---the gravitational force on a mass
$m{}$:

::: {#eip-id1171442268322 data-type="equation"}
$${w = \text{mg}}.$$
:::

Since ${{g =}9.80\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}$ on Earth, the weight of a 1.0 kg
object on Earth is 9.8 N, as we see:

::: {#eip-id1171443439158 data-type="equation"}
$${{{w = \text{mg}} = (}1\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(9.80\ \text{m/s}^{2}{) = 9.8}\ \text{N}}.$$
:::

Recall that $g{}$ can take a positive or negative value, depending on
the positive direction in the coordinate system. Be sure to take this
into consideration when solving problems with weight.
:::

When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it
is in [free-fall]{#import-auto-id1999571 data-type="term"}. That is, the
only force acting on the object is the force of gravity. In the real
world, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in
free-fall because there is always some upward force from the air acting
on the object.

The acceleration due to gravity $g{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*
varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so that the weight of an
object depends on location and is not an intrinsic property of the
object. Weight varies dramatically if one leaves Earth's surface. On the
Moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only
${1.67\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}$. A 1.0-kg mass thus has a weight of 9.8 N on
Earth and only about 1.7 N on the Moon.

The broadest definition of weight in this sense is that *the weight of
an object is the gravitational force on it from the nearest large body*,
such as Earth, the Moon, the Sun, and so on. This is the most common and
useful definition of weight in physics. It differs dramatically,
however, from the definition of weight used by NASA and the popular
media in relation to space travel and exploration. When they speak of
"weightlessness" and "microgravity," they are really referring to the
phenomenon we call "free-fall" in physics. We shall use the above
definition of weight, and we will make careful distinctions between
free-fall and actual weightlessness.

It is important to be aware that weight and mass are very different
physical quantities, although they are closely related. Mass is the
quantity of matter (how much "stuff") and does not vary in classical
physics, whereas weight is the gravitational force and does vary
depending on gravity. It is tempting to equate the two, since most of
our examples take place on Earth, where the weight of an object only
varies a little with the location of the object. Furthermore, the terms
*mass* and *weight* are used interchangeably in everyday language; for
example, our medical records often show our "weight" in kilograms, but
never in the correct units of newtons.

::: {#fs-id1570965 .note data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label=""}
::: {data-type="title"}
Common Misconceptions: Mass vs. Weight
:::

Mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language.
However, in science, these terms are distinctly different from one
another. Mass is a measure of how much matter is in an object. The
typical measure of mass is the kilogram (or the "slug" in English
units). Weight, on the other hand, is a measure of the force of gravity
acting on an object. Weight is equal to the mass of an object ($m{}$)
multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity ($g{}$). Like any other
force, weight is measured in terms of newtons (or pounds in English
units).

Assuming the mass of an object is kept intact, it will remain the same,
regardless of its location. However, because weight depends on the
acceleration due to gravity, the weight of an object *can change* when
the object enters into a region with stronger or weaker gravity. For
example, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is
${1.67\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}$ (which is much less than the acceleration due
to gravity on Earth, ${9.80\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}$). If you measured your
weight on Earth and then measured your weight on the Moon, you would
find that you "weigh" much less, even though you do not look any
skinnier. This is because the force of gravity is weaker on the Moon. In
fact, when people say that they are "losing weight," they really mean
that they are losing "mass" (which in turn causes them to weigh less).

Take-Home Experiment: Mass and Weight
:::

What do bathroom scales measure? When you stand on a bathroom scale,
what happens to the scale? It depresses slightly. The scale contains
springs that compress in proportion to your weight---similar to rubber
bands expanding when pulled. The springs provide a measure of your
weight (for an object which is not accelerating). This is a force in
newtons (or pounds). In most countries, the measurement is divided by
9.80 to give a reading in mass units of kilograms. The scale measures
weight but is calibrated to provide information about mass. While
standing on a bathroom scale, push down on a table next to you. What
happens to the reading? Why? Would your scale measure the same "mass" on
Earth as on the Moon?

The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as that of the
net force, which is parallel to the ground. There is no information
given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the
system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For
example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be
greater than the friction opposing the motion (since we know the mower
moves forward), and the vertical forces must cancel if there is to be no
acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only
horizontally). The acceleration found is small enough to be reasonable
for a person pushing a mower. Such an effort would not last too long
because the person's top speed would soon be reached.

What Rocket Thrust Accelerates This Sled?
:::

Prior to manned space flights, rocket sleds were used to test aircraft,
missile equipment, and physiological effects on human subjects at high
speeds. They consisted of a platform that was mounted on one or two
rails and propelled by several rockets. Calculate the magnitude of force
exerted by each rocket, called its thrust $\textbf{T}{}$, for the
four-rocket propulsion system shown in
[link](#fs-id2407992){.autogenerated-content}. The sled's initial
acceleration is ${{\text{49}\ \text{m/s}^{2}},}{}$ the mass of the
system is 2100 kg, and the force of friction opposing the motion is
known to be 650 N.

![A sled experiences a rocket thrust that accelerates it to the right.
Each rocket creates an identical thrust $\textbf{T}{}$. As in other
situations where there is only horizontal acceleration, the vertical
forces cancel. The ground exerts an upward force $\textbf{N}{}$ on the
system that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to its
weight, $\textbf{w}{}$. The system here is the sled, its rockets, and
rider, so none of the forces *between* these objects are considered. The
arrow representing friction ($\textbf{f}{}$) is drawn larger than
scale.](images/Figure_04_03_04.jpg){#fs-id2407992}

Although there are forces acting vertically and horizontally, we assume
the vertical forces cancel since there is no vertical acceleration. This
leaves us with only horizontal forces and a simpler one-dimensional
problem. Directions are indicated with plus or minus signs, with right
taken as the positive direction. See the free-body diagram in the
figure.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

Since acceleration, mass, and the force of friction are given, we start
with Newton's second law and look for ways to find the thrust of the
engines. Since we have defined the direction of the force and
acceleration as acting "to the right," we need to consider only the
magnitudes of these quantities in the calculations. Hence we begin with

::: {#eip-id2420800 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}},$$
:::

where $F_{\text{net}}{}$ is the net force along the horizontal
direction. We can see from [link](#fs-id2407992){.autogenerated-content}
that the engine thrusts add, while friction opposes the thrust. In
equation form, the net external force is

::: {#eip-id1522873 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = {4T - f}}.$$
:::

Substituting this into Newton's second law gives

::: {#eip-id1858333 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}} = {4T - f}}.$$
:::

Using a little algebra, we solve for the total thrust 4*T*:

::: {#eip-id1948969 data-type="equation"}
$${4T = {\text{ma} + f}}.$$
:::

Substituting known values yields

::: {#eip-id2054706 data-type="equation"}
$${{{4T = {\text{ma} + f}} = (}\text{2100\ kg})(\text{49\ m/s}^{2}{) + \text{650\ N}}}.$$

So the total thrust is

$${{4T = 1.0}{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}},$$

The numbers are quite large, so the result might surprise you.
Experiments such as this were performed in the early 1960s to test the
limits of human endurance and the setup designed to protect human
subjects in jet fighter emergency ejections. Speeds of 1000 km/h were
obtained, with accelerations of 45 $g{}$\'s. (Recall that $g{}$, the
acceleration due to gravity, is ${9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$. When
we say that an acceleration is 45 $g{}$\'s, it is
${\text{45}\times 9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$, which is
approximately $\text{440\ m/s}^{2}{}$.) While living subjects are not
used any more, land speeds of 10,000 km/h have been obtained with rocket
sleds. In this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest
is obvious. We will see in later examples that choosing the system of
interest is crucial---and the choice is not always obvious.

Newton's second law of motion is more than a definition; it is a
relationship among acceleration, force, and mass. It can help us make
predictions. Each of those physical quantities can be defined
independently, so the second law tells us something basic and universal
about nature. The next section introduces the third and final law of
motion.

Applying the Science Practices: Sums of Forces

Recall that forces are vector quantities, and therefore the net force
acting on a system should be the vector sum of the forces.

\(a\) Design an experiment to test this hypothesis. What sort of a
system would be appropriate and convenient to have multiple forces
applied to it? What features of the system should be held constant? What
could be varied? Can forces be arranged in multiple directions so that,
while the hypothesis is still tested, the resulting calculations are not
too inconvenient?

\(b\) Another group of students has done such an experiment, using a
motion capture system looking down at an air hockey table to measure the
motion of the 0.10-kg puck. The table was aligned with the cardinal
directions, and a compressed air hose was placed in the center of each
side, capable of varying levels of force output and fixed so that it was
aimed at the center of the table.

Since astronauts in orbit are apparently weightless, a clever method of
measuring their masses is needed to monitor their mass gains or losses
to adjust diets. One way to do this is to exert a known force on an
astronaut and measure the acceleration produced. Suppose a net external
force of 50.0 N is exerted and the astronaut's acceleration is measured
to be ${0\text{.}\text{893\ m/s}^{2}}{}$. (a) Calculate her mass. (b) By
exerting a force on the astronaut, the vehicle in which they orbit
experiences an equal and opposite force. Discuss how this would affect
the measurement of the astronaut's acceleration. Propose a method in
which recoil of the vehicle is avoided.

system
:   defined by the boundaries of an object or collection of objects
    being observed; all forces originating from outside of the system
    are considered external forces

There are many interesting applications of Newton's laws of motion, a
few more of which are presented in this section. These serve also to
illustrate some further subtleties of physics and to help build
problem-solving skills.

Drag Force on a Barge
:::

Suppose two tugboats push on a barge at different angles, as shown in
[link](#import-auto-id1221020){.autogenerated-content}. The first
tugboat exerts a force of ${2.7{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}}{}$ in
the *x*-direction, and the second tugboat exerts a force of
${3.6{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}}{}$ in the *y*-direction.

![(a) A view from above of two tugboats pushing on a barge. (b) The
free-body diagram for the ship contains only forces acting in the plane
of the water. It omits the two vertical forces---the weight of the barge
and the buoyant force of the water supporting it cancel and are not
shown. Since the applied forces are perpendicular, the *x*- and *y*-axes
are in the same direction as $\textbf{F}_{x}{}$ and $\textbf{F}_{y}{}$.
The problem quickly becomes a one-dimensional problem along the
direction of $\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$, since friction is in the
direction opposite to
$\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$.](images/Figure_04_07_01.jpg){#import-auto-id1221020}

If the mass of the barge is ${{5.0 \times \text{10}^{6}}\ \text{kg}}{}$
and its acceleration is observed to be
${7\text{.}{\text{5} \times \text{10}^{- 2}}\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}$ in the
direction shown, what is the drag force of the water on the barge
resisting the motion? (Note: drag force is a frictional force exerted by
fluids, such as air or water. The drag force opposes the motion of the
object.)

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

The directions and magnitudes of acceleration and the applied forces are
given in [link](#import-auto-id1221020){.autogenerated-content}**(a)**.
We will define the total force of the tugboats on the barge as
$\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$ so that:

::: {#eip-id1203757 data-type="equation"}
$$\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}\text{=}\textbf{F}_{\mathit{x}} + \textbf{F}_{\mathit{y}}$$
:::

Since the barge is flat bottomed, the drag of the water
$\textbf{F}_{\text{D}}{}$ will be in the direction opposite to
$\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$, as shown in the free-body diagram in
[link](#import-auto-id1221020){.autogenerated-content}(b). The system of
interest here is the barge, since the forces on
*it`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* are given as well as its
acceleration. Our strategy is to find the magnitude and direction of the
net applied force $\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$, and then apply Newton's
second law to solve for the drag force $\textbf{F}_{\text{D}}{}$.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

Since $\textbf{F}_{x}{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* and
$\textbf{F}_{y}{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* are perpendicular,
the magnitude and direction of $\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$ are easily
found. First, the resultant magnitude is given by the Pythagorean
theorem:

::: {#eip-id2112578 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lllll}
F_{\text{app}} & = & \sqrt{\text{F}_{x}^{2} + \text{F}_{y}^{2}} & & \\
F_{\text{app}} & = & \sqrt{(2.7{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}{)^{2} + (}3.6{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N})^{2}} & = & {{4.5 \times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N.}} \\
\end{array}{}$$
:::

The angle is given by

::: {#eip-id3026466 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
\theta & = & {\text{tan}^{- 1}\left( \frac{F_{y}}{F_{x}} \right)} \\
\theta & = & {\text{tan}^{- 1}{\left( \frac{3.6{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}}{2.7{\times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}} \right) = \text{53º}},} \\
\end{array}{}$$
:::

which we know, because of Newton's first law, is the same direction as
the acceleration. $\textbf{F}_{\text{D}}{}$ is in the opposite direction
of $\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$, since it acts to slow down the
acceleration. Therefore, the net external force is in the same direction
as $\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$, but its magnitude is slightly less than
$\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$. The problem is now one-dimensional. From
[link](#import-auto-id1221020){.autogenerated-content}**(b)**, we can
see that

::: {#eip-id1624544 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = {F_{\text{app}} - F_{\text{D}}}}.$$
:::

But Newton's second law states that

::: {#eip-id1230866 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}.$$
:::

Thus,

::: {#eip-id2268355 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{app}} - F_{\text{D}}} = \text{ma}}.$$
:::

This can be solved for the magnitude of the drag force of the water
$F_{\text{D}}{}$ in terms of known quantities:

::: {#eip-id1464099 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{D}} = {F_{\text{app}} - \text{ma}}}.$$
:::

Substituting known values gives

::: {#eip-id1715978 data-type="equation"}
$${{\text{F}_{\text{D}} = (}4\text{.}{\text{5} \times \text{10}^{5}}\ \text{N}{) - (}5\text{.}{\text{0} \times \text{10}^{6}}\ \text{kg})(7\text{.}{\text{5} \times \text{10}^{\text{–2}}}\ \text{m/s}^{2}{) = 7}\text{.}{\text{5} \times \text{10}^{4}}\ \text{N}}.$$
:::

The direction of $\textbf{F}_{\text{D}}{}$ has already been determined
to be in the direction opposite to $\textbf{F}_{\text{app}}{}$, or at an
angle of $\text{53º}{}$ south of west.

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

The numbers used in this example are reasonable for a moderately large
barge. It is certainly difficult to obtain larger accelerations with
tugboats, and small speeds are desirable to avoid running the barge into
the docks. Drag is relatively small for a well-designed hull at low
speeds, consistent with the answer to this example, where
$F_{\text{D}}{}$ is less than 1/600th of the weight of the ship.
:::

In the earlier example of a tightrope walker we noted that the tensions
in wires supporting a mass were equal only because the angles on either
side were equal. Consider the following example, where the angles are
not equal; slightly more trigonometry is involved.

::: {#fs-id1348788 data-type="example"}

Different Tensions at Different Angles
:::

Consider the traffic light (mass 15.0 kg) suspended from two wires as
shown in [link](#import-auto-id3051538){.autogenerated-content}. Find
the tension in each wire, neglecting the masses of the wires.

![A traffic light is suspended from two wires. (b) Some of the forces
involved. (c) Only forces acting on the system are shown here. The
free-body diagram for the traffic light is also shown. (d) The forces

components of the tensions must cancel, and the sum of the vertical
components of the tensions must equal the weight of the traffic light.
(e) The free-body diagram shows the vertical and horizontal forces
acting on the traffic
light.](images/Figure_04_07_02.jpg){#import-auto-id3051538}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

The system of interest is the traffic light, and its free-body diagram
is shown in [link](#import-auto-id3051538){.autogenerated-content}(c).
The three forces involved are not parallel, and so they must be
projected onto a coordinate system. The most convenient coordinate
system has one axis vertical and one horizontal, and the vector
projections on it are shown in part (d) of the figure. There are two
unknowns in this problem ($T_{1}{}$ and $T_{2}{}$), so two equations are
needed to find them. These two equations come from applying Newton's
second law along the vertical and horizontal axes, noting that the net
external force is zero along each axis because acceleration is zero.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

First consider the horizontal or *x*-axis:

::: {#eip-id2514755 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{net}x} = {T_{\text{2}x} - T_{\text{1}x}}} = 0}.$$
:::

Thus, as you might expect,

::: {#eip-id2540452 data-type="equation"}
$${T_{\text{1}x} = T_{\text{2}x}}.$$
:::

This gives us the following relationship between $T_{1}{}$ and
$T_{2}{}$:

::: {#eip-id2122298 data-type="equation"}
$${T_{1}\ \text{cos}\ (\text{30º}{) = T_{2}}\ \text{cos}\ (\text{45º})}.$$
:::

Thus,

::: {#eip-id2577136 data-type="equation"}
$${{T_{2} = (}1\text{.}\text{225})T_{1}}.$$
:::

Note that $T_{1}{}$ and $T_{2}{}$ are not equal in this case, because
the angles on either side are not equal. It is reasonable that $T_{2}{}$
ends up being greater than $T_{1}{}$, because it is exerted more
vertically than $T_{1}{}$.

Now consider the force components along the vertical or *y*-axis:

::: {#eip-id2308230 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{net}\ y} = {{T_{\text{1}y} + T_{\text{2}y}} - w}} = 0}.$$
:::

This implies

::: {#eip-id1339509 data-type="equation"}
$${{T_{\text{1}y} + T_{\text{2}y}} = w}.$$
:::

Substituting the expressions for the vertical components gives

::: {#eip-id1925561 data-type="equation"}
$${T_{1}\ \text{sin}\ (\text{30º}{) + T_{2}}\ \text{sin}\ (\text{45º}{) = w}}.$$
:::

There are two unknowns in this equation, but substituting the expression
for $T_{2}{}$ in terms of $T_{1}{}$ reduces this to one equation with
one unknown:

::: {#eip-id2259246 data-type="equation"}
$${T_{1}(0\text{.}\text{500}{) + (}1\text{.}\text{225}T_{1})(0\text{.}\text{707}{{) = w} = \text{mg}}},$$
:::

which yields

::: {#eip-id2556360 data-type="equation"}
$${\left( {1\text{.}\text{366}} \right){T_{1} = (}\text{15}\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2})}.$$
:::

Solving this last equation gives the magnitude of
$T_{1}{}$**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** to be

::: {#eip-id1747068 data-type="equation"}
$${T_{1} = \text{108\ N}}.$$
:::

Finally, the magnitude of $T_{2}{}$ is determined using the relationship
between them, $T_{2}{}$ = 1.225 $T_{1}{}$, found above. Thus we obtain

::: {#eip-id1744019 data-type="equation"}
$${T_{2} = \text{132\ N}}.$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

Both tensions would be larger if both wires were more horizontal, and
they will be equal if and only if the angles on either side are the same
(as they were in the earlier example of a tightrope walker).
:::

The bathroom scale is an excellent example of a normal force acting on a
body. It provides a quantitative reading of how much it must push upward
to support the weight of an object. But can you predict what you would
see on the dial of a bathroom scale if you stood on it during an
elevator ride? Will you see a value greater than your weight when the
elevator starts up? What about when the elevator moves upward at a
constant speed: will the scale still read more than your weight at rest?
Consider the following example.

::: {#fs-id2654282 data-type="example"}
::: {data-type="title"}
What Does the Bathroom Scale Read in an Elevator?
:::

[link](#import-auto-id347645){.autogenerated-content} shows a 75.0-kg
man (weight of about 165 lb) standing on a bathroom scale in an
elevator. Calculate the scale reading: (a) if the elevator accelerates
upward at a rate of ${1\text{.}\text{20\ m/s}^{2}}{}$, and (b) if the
elevator moves upward at a constant speed of 1 m/s.

![(a) The various forces acting when a person stands on a bathroom scale
in an elevator. The arrows are approximately correct for when the
elevator is accelerating upward---broken arrows represent forces too
large to be drawn to scale. $\textbf{T}{}$ is the tension in the
supporting cable, $\textbf{w}{}$ is the weight of the person,
$\textbf{w}_{\text{s}}{}$ is the weight of the scale,
$\textbf{w}_{\text{e}}{}$ is the weight of the elevator,
$\textbf{F}_{\text{s}}{}$ is the force of the scale on the person,
$\textbf{F}_{\text{p}}{}$ is the force of the person on the scale,
$\textbf{F}_{\text{t}}{}$ is the force of the scale on the floor of the
elevator, and $\textbf{N}{}$ is the force of the floor upward on the
scale. (b) The free-body diagram shows only the external forces acting
on the designated system of interest---the
person.](images/Figure%2004_07_03.jpg){#import-auto-id347645}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

If the scale is accurate, its reading will equal $F_{\text{p}}{}$, the
magnitude of the force the person exerts downward on it.
[link](#import-auto-id347645){.autogenerated-content}(a) shows the
numerous forces acting on the elevator, scale, and person. It makes this
one-dimensional problem look much more formidable than if the person is
chosen to be the system of interest and a free-body diagram is drawn as
in [link](#import-auto-id347645){.autogenerated-content}(b). Analysis of
the free-body diagram using Newton's laws can produce answers to both
parts (a) and (b) of this example, as well as some other questions that
might arise. The only forces acting on the person are his weight
$\textbf{w}{}$ and the upward force of the scale
$\textbf{F}_{\text{s}}{}$. According to Newton's third law
$\textbf{F}_{\text{p}}{}$ and $\textbf{F}_{\text{s}}{}$ are equal in
magnitude and opposite in direction, so that we need to find
$F_{\text{s}}{}$ in order to find what the scale reads. We can do this,
as usual, by applying Newton's second law,

::: {#eip-id2548908 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}.$$
:::

From the free-body diagram we see that
${F_{\text{net}} = {F_{\text{s}} - w}}{}$, so that

::: {#eip-id2522872 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{s}} - w} = \text{ma}}.$$
:::

Solving for $F_{\text{s}}{}$ gives an equation with only one unknown:

::: {#eip-id1957748 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{s}} = {\text{ma} + w}},$$
:::

or, because $w = {mg}$, simply

::: {#eip-id3507099 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{s}} = {\text{ma} + \text{mg}}}.$$
:::

No assumptions were made about the acceleration, and so this solution
should be valid for a variety of accelerations in addition to the ones
in this exercise.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution for (a)]{data-type="title"}
:::

In this part of the problem, ${a = 1.20\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}$, so that

::: {#eip-id1966528 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{s}} = (}\text{75}\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(1\text{.}\text{20\ m/s}^{2}{) + (}\text{75}\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2})},$$
:::

yielding

::: {#eip-id1707818 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{s}} = 8}\text{25\ N}}.$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion for (a)]{data-type="title"}
:::

This is about 185 lb. What would the scale have read if he were
stationary? Since his acceleration would be zero, the force of the scale
would be equal to his weight:

::: {#eip-id2384618 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
F_{\text{net}} & = & {\text{ma} = 0 = {F_{\text{s}} - w}} \\
F_{\text{s}} & = & {w = \text{mg}} \\
F_{\text{s}} & = & {(\text{75.0\ kg})(9.\text{80\ m/s}^{2})} \\
F_{\text{s}} & = & \text{735\ N.} \\
\end{array}$$
:::

So, the scale reading in the elevator is greater than his 735-N (165 lb)
weight. This means that the scale is pushing up on the person with a
force greater than his weight, as it must in order to accelerate him
upward. Clearly, the greater the acceleration of the elevator, the
greater the scale reading, consistent with what you feel in rapidly
accelerating versus slowly accelerating elevators.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution for (b)]{data-type="title"}
:::

Now, what happens when the elevator reaches a constant upward velocity?
Will the scale still read more than his weight? For any constant
velocity---up, down, or stationary---acceleration is zero because
${a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}}{}$, and ${\Delta v = 0}{}$.

Thus,

::: {#eip-id2587837 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{s}} = {\text{ma} + \text{mg}}} = {0 + \text{mg}}}.$$
:::

Now

::: {#eip-id1546720 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{s}} = (}\text{75}\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2})},$$
:::

which gives

::: {#eip-id1499798 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{s}} = 7}\text{35\ N}}.$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion for (b)]{data-type="title"}
:::

The scale reading is 735 N, which equals the person's weight. This will
be the case whenever the elevator has a constant velocity---moving up,
moving down, or stationary.
:::

The solution to the previous example also applies to an elevator
accelerating downward, as mentioned. When an elevator accelerates
downward, $a{}$ is negative, and the scale reading is *less* than the
weight of the person, until a constant downward velocity is reached, at
which time the scale reading again becomes equal to the person's weight.
If the elevator is in free-fall and accelerating downward at $g{}$, then
the scale reading will be zero and the person will *appear* to be
weightless.

### Integrating Concepts: Newton's Laws of Motion and Kinematics {#integrating-concepts-newtons-laws-of-motion-and-kinematics data-type="title"}

Physics is most interesting and most powerful when applied to general
situations that involve more than a narrow set of physical principles.
Newton's laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that
have been discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion.
For example, forces produce accelerations, a topic of kinematics, and
hence the relevance of earlier chapters. When approaching problems that
involve various types of forces, acceleration, velocity, and/or
position, use the following steps to approach the problem:

**Problem-Solving Strategy**

Step 1. *Identify which physical principles are involved*. Listing the
givens and the quantities to be calculated will allow you to identify
the principles involved. [\
]{data-type="newline"}Step 2. *Solve the problem using strategies
outlined in the text*. If these are available for the specific topic,
you should refer to them. You should also refer to the sections of the
text that deal with a particular topic. The following worked example
illustrates how these strategies are applied to an integrated concept
problem.

What Force Must a Soccer Player Exert to Reach Top Speed?

A soccer player starts from rest and accelerates forward, reaching a

(b) What average force did he exert backward on the ground to achieve
this acceleration? The player's mass is 70.0 kg, and air resistance is
negligible.

**Strategy**

1.  [*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* To solve an *integrated concept
    problem*, we must first identify the physical principles involved
    and identify the chapters in which they are found. Part (a) of this
    example considers *acceleration* along a straight line. This is a
    topic of *kinematics*. Part (b) deals with *force*, a topic of
    *dynamics* found in this chapter.]{#import-auto-id2956703}
2.  [*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* The following solutions to each
    part of the example illustrate how the specific problem-solving
    strategies are applied. These involve identifying knowns and
    unknowns, checking to see if the answer is reasonable, and so
    forth.]{#import-auto-id3020678}

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution for (a)]{data-type="title"}

We are given the initial and final velocities (zero and 8.00 m/s
forward); thus, the change in velocity is $\Delta v = 8.00\ m/s$. We are
given the elapsed time, and so ${\Delta t = 2.50\ s}{}$. The unknown is
acceleration, which can be found from its definition:

::: {#eip-id1739294 data-type="equation"}
$${a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}}.$$
:::

Substituting the known values yields

::: {#eip-id2063281 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}

Here we are asked to find the average force the player exerts backward
to achieve this forward acceleration. Neglecting air resistance, this
would be equal in magnitude to the net external force on the player,
since this force causes his acceleration. Since we now know the player's
acceleration and are given his mass, we can use Newton's second law to
find the force exerted. That is,

::: {#eip-id1756199 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}.$$
:::

Substituting the known values of $m{}$ and $a{}$ gives

$$\begin{array}{lll}
F_{\text{net}} & = & {(\text{70.0\ kg})(3\text{.}\text{20\ m/s}^{2})} \\

This is about 50 pounds, a reasonable average force.

This worked example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies
to situations that include topics from different chapters. The first
step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The
second step is to solve for the unknown using familiar problem-solving
strategies. These strategies are found throughout the text, and many
worked examples show how to use them for single topics. You will find
these techniques for integrated concept problems useful in applications
of physics outside of a physics course, such as in your profession, in
other science disciplines, and in everyday life. The following problems
will build your skills in the broad application of physical principles.

force of 38 N. The net force is equal to the sum of the two applied
forces. It can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:

$\begin{matrix}
{F_{\text{net}} =} & \sqrt{F_{x}{}^{2} + F_{y}{}^{w}} \\
 & {= \sqrt{{(38\,\text{N})}^{2} + {(64\,\text{N})}^{2}}} \\
 & {= 74.4\,\text{N}} \\
\end{matrix}$

Since $a = \frac{F}{m}$,

$\begin{matrix}
a & {= \frac{74.4\,\text{N}}{825\,\text{kg}}} \\
 & {= 0.09\,\text{m/s}^{\text{2}}} \\
\end{matrix}$

The boulder will accelerate at 0.09 m/s^2^.

### Summary { data-type="title"}

-   [Newton's laws of motion can be applied in numerous situations to
    solve problems of motion.]{#import-auto-id1586681}
-   [Some problems will contain multiple force vectors acting in
    different directions on an object. Be sure to draw diagrams, resolve
    all force vectors into horizontal and vertical components, and draw
    a free-body diagram. Always analyze the direction in which an object
    accelerates so that you can determine whether
    ${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}{}$ or ${F_{\text{net}} = 0}{}$
    .]{#import-auto-id1586684}
-   [The normal force on an object is not always equal in magnitude to
    the weight of the object. If an object is accelerating, the normal
    force will be less than or greater than the weight of the object.
    Also, if the object is on an inclined plane, the normal force will
    always be less than the full weight of the
    object.]{#import-auto-id3305501}
-   [Some problems will contain various physical quantities, such as
    forces, acceleration, velocity, or position. You can apply concepts
    from kinematics and dynamics in order to solve these problems of
    motion.]{#import-auto-id2653368}

To simulate the apparent weightlessness of space orbit, astronauts are
trained in the hold of a cargo aircraft that is accelerating downward at
$g{}$. Why will they appear to be weightless, as measured by standing on
a bathroom scale, in this accelerated frame of reference? Is there any
difference between their apparent weightlessness in orbit and in the
aircraft?

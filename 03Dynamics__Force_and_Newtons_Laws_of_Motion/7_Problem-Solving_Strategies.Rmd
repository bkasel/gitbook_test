Success in problem solving is obviously necessary to understand and
apply physical principles, not to mention the more immediate need of
passing exams. The basics of problem solving, presented earlier in this
text, are followed here, but specific strategies useful in applying
Newton's laws of motion are emphasized. These techniques also reinforce
concepts that are useful in many other areas of physics. Many
problem-solving strategies are stated outright in the worked examples,
and so the following techniques should reinforce skills you have already
begun to develop.

### Problem-Solving Strategy for Newton's Laws of Motion {#problem-solving-strategy-for-newtons-laws-of-motion data-type="title"}

Step 1. As usual, it is first necessary to identify the physical
principles involved. *Once it is determined that Newton's laws of motion
are involved (if the problem involves forces), it is particularly
important to draw a careful sketch of the situation*. Such a sketch is
shown in [link](#import-auto-id1669409){.autogenerated-content}(a).
Then, as in [link](#import-auto-id1669409){.autogenerated-content}(b),
use arrows to represent all forces, label them carefully, and make their
lengths and directions correspond to the forces they represent (whenever
sufficient information exists).

![(a) A sketch of Tarzan hanging from a vine. (b) Arrows are used to
represent all forces. $\textbf{T}{}$ is the tension in the vine above
Tarzan, $\textbf{F}_{\text{T}}{}$ is the force he exerts on the vine,
and $\textbf{w}{}$ is his weight. All other forces, such as the nudge of
a breeze, are assumed negligible. (c) Suppose we are given the ape man's
mass and asked to find the tension in the vine. We then define the
system of interest as shown and draw a free-body diagram.
$\textbf{F}_{\text{T}}{}$ is no longer shown, because it is not a force
acting on the system of interest; rather, $\textbf{F}_{\text{T}}{}$ acts
on the outside world. (d) Showing only the arrows, the head-to-tail
method of addition is used. It is apparent that
${\textbf{T} = - \mathbf{w}}{}$, if Tarzan is
stationary.](images/Figure%2004_06_01.jpg){#import-auto-id1669409}

Step 2. Identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be
inferred from the problem as stated. That is, make a list of knowns and
unknowns. *Then carefully determine the system of interest*. This
decision is a crucial step, since Newton's second law involves only
external forces. Once the system of interest has been identified, it
becomes possible to determine which forces are external and which are
internal, a necessary step to employ Newton's second law. (See
[link](#import-auto-id1669409){.autogenerated-content}(c).) Newton's
third law may be used to identify whether forces are exerted between
components of a system (internal) or between the system and something
outside (external). As illustrated earlier in this chapter, the system
of interest depends on what question we need to answer. This choice
becomes easier with practice, eventually developing into an almost
unconscious process. Skill in clearly defining systems will be
beneficial in later chapters as well. [\
]{data-type="newline"}[\
]{data-type="newline"}A diagram showing the system of interest and all
of the external forces is called a [free-body
diagram]{#import-auto-id1606094 data-type="term"}. Only forces are shown
on free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. We have drawn
several of these in worked examples.
[link](#import-auto-id1669409){.autogenerated-content}(c) shows a
free-body diagram for the system of interest. Note that no internal
forces are shown in a free-body diagram.

Step 3. Once a free-body diagram is drawn, *Newton's second law can be
applied to solve the problem*. This is done in
[link](#import-auto-id1669409){.autogenerated-content}(d) for a
particular situation. In general, once external forces are clearly
identified in free-body diagrams, it should be a straightforward task to
put them into equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in all
previous examples. If the problem is one-dimensional---that is, if all
forces are parallel---then they add like scalars. If the problem is
two-dimensional, then it must be broken down into a pair of
one-dimensional problems. This is done by projecting the force vectors
onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous examples,
the choice of axes can simplify the problem. For example, when an
incline is involved, a set of axes with one axis parallel to the incline
and one perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always
convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion, if this
is known.

Applying Newton's Second Law
:::

Before you write net force equations, it is critical to determine
whether the system is accelerating in a particular direction. If the
acceleration is zero in a particular direction, then the net force is
zero in that direction. Similarly, if the acceleration is nonzero in a
particular direction, then the net force is described by the equation:
${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}}{}$.

For example, if the system is accelerating in the horizontal direction,
but it is not accelerating in the vertical direction, then you will have
the following conclusions:

::: {#eip-id1449134 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}\ x} = \text{ma}},$$
:::

::: {#eip-id1478667 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}\ y} = 0}.$$
:::

You will need this information in order to determine unknown forces
acting in a system.
:::

Step 4. As always, *check the solution to see whether it is reasonable*.
In some cases, this is obvious. For example, it is reasonable to find
that friction causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than
when no friction exists. In practice, intuition develops gradually
through problem solving, and with experience it becomes progressively
easier to judge whether an answer is reasonable. Another way to check
your solution is to check the units. If you are solving for force and
end up with units of m/s, then you have made a mistake.

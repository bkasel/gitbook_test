There is a passage in the musical *Man of la
Mancha`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* that relates to Newton's third law
of motion. Sancho, in describing a fight with his wife to Don Quixote,
says, "Of course I hit her back, Your Grace, but she's a lot harder than
me and you know what they say, 'Whether the stone hits the pitcher or
the pitcher hits the stone, it's going to be bad for the pitcher.'" This
is exactly what happens whenever one body exerts a force on
another---the first also experiences a force (equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction). Numerous common experiences, such as stubbing a
toe or throwing a ball, confirm this. It is precisely stated in
[Newton's third law of motion]{#import-auto-id1260844 data-type="term"}.

Newton's Third Law of Motion
:::

Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body
experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
to the force that it exerts.
:::

This law represents a certain *symmetry in nature*: Forces always occur
in pairs, and one body cannot exert a force on another without
experiencing a force itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as
"action-reaction," where the force exerted is the action and the force
experienced as a consequence is the reaction. Newton's third law has
practical uses in analyzing the origin of forces and understanding which
forces are external to a system.

We can readily see Newton's third law at work by taking a look at how
people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a
pool, as illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id2338100){.autogenerated-content}. She pushes
against the pool wall with her feet and accelerates in the direction
*opposite* to that of her push. The wall has exerted an equal and
opposite force back on the swimmer. You might think that two equal and
opposite forces would cancel, but they do not *because they act on
different systems*. In this case, there are two systems that we could
investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we select the swimmer to be the
system of interest, as in the figure, then
$\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}$ is an external force on this
system and affects its motion. The swimmer moves in the direction of
$\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}$. In contrast, the force
$\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}$ acts on the wall and not on our
system of interest. Thus $\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}$ does not
directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel
$\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}$. Note that the swimmer pushes in
the direction opposite to that in which she wishes to move. The reaction
to her push is thus in the desired direction.

![When the swimmer exerts a force $\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}$
on the wall, she accelerates in the direction opposite to that of her
push. This means the net external force on her is in the direction
opposite to $\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}$. This opposition
occurs because, in accordance with Newton's third law of motion, the
wall exerts a force $\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}$ on her, equal
in magnitude but in the direction opposite to the one she exerts on it.
The line around the swimmer indicates the system of interest. Note that
$\textbf{F}_{\text{feet\ on\ wall}}{}$ does not act on this system (the
swimmer) and, thus, does not cancel
$\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}$. Thus the free-body diagram shows
only $\textbf{F}_{\text{wall\ on\ feet}}{}$, $\textbf{w}{}$, the
gravitational force, and $\textbf{BF}{}$, the buoyant force of the water
supporting the swimmer's weight. The vertical forces $\textbf{w}{}$ and
$\textbf{BF}{}$ cancel since there is no vertical
motion.](images/Figure_04_04_01.jpg){#import-auto-id2338100}

Similarly, when a person stands on Earth, the Earth exerts a force on
the person, pulling the person toward the Earth. As stated by Newton's
third law of motion, the person also exerts a force that is equal in
magnitude, but opposite in direction, pulling the Earth up toward the
person. Since the mass of the Earth is so great, however, and $F = ma$,
the acceleration of the Earth toward the person is not noticeable.

Other examples of Newton's third law are easy to find. As a professor
paces in front of a whiteboard, she exerts a force backward on the
floor. The floor exerts a reaction force forward on the professor that
causes her to accelerate forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because
the ground pushes forward on the drive wheels in reaction to the drive
wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the
wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks
backward. In another example, rockets move forward by expelling gas
backward at high velocity. This means the rocket exerts a large backward
force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber, and the gas therefore
exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket. This reaction force
is called [thrust]{#import-auto-id1295864 data-type="term"}. It is a
common misconception that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the
ground or on the air behind them. They actually work better in a vacuum,
where they can more readily expel the exhaust gases. Helicopters
similarly create lift by pushing air down, thereby experiencing an
upward reaction force. Birds and airplanes also fly by exerting force on
air in a direction opposite to that of whatever force they need. For
example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward in order to
get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself in the water by
ejecting water through a funnel from its body, similar to a jet ski. In
a situation similar to Sancho's, professional cage fighters experience
reaction forces when they punch, sometimes breaking their hand by
hitting an opponent's body.

Getting Up To Speed: Choosing the Correct System
:::

A physics professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment to a
lecture hall, as seen in
[link](#import-auto-id2324690){.autogenerated-content}. Her mass is 65.0
kg, the cart's is 12.0 kg, and the equipment's is 7.0 kg. Calculate the
acceleration produced when the professor exerts a backward force of 150
N on the floor. All forces opposing the motion, such as friction on the
cart's wheels and air resistance, total 24.0 N.

![A professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment. The lengths of
the arrows are proportional to the magnitudes of the forces (except for
$\textbf{f}{}$, since it is too small to draw to scale). Different
questions are asked in each example; thus, the system of interest must
be defined differently for each. System 1 is appropriate for this
example, since it asks for the acceleration of the entire group of
objects. Only $\textbf{F}_{\text{floor}}{}$ and $\textbf{f}{}$ are
external forces acting on System 1 along the line of motion. All other
forces either cancel or act on the outside world. System 2 is chosen for
[link](#fs-id2092526){.autogenerated-content} so that
$\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}$ will be an external force and enter into
Newton's second law. Note that the free-body diagrams, which allow us to
apply Newton's second law, vary with the system
chosen.](images/Figure_04_04_02.jpg){#import-auto-id2324690}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

Since they accelerate as a unit, we define the system to be the
professor, cart, and equipment. This is System 1 in
[link](#import-auto-id2324690){.autogenerated-content}. The professor
pushes backward with a force $\textbf{F}_{\text{foot}}{}$ of 150 N.
According to Newton's third law, the floor exerts a forward reaction
force $\textbf{F}_{\text{floor}}{}$ of 150 N on System 1. Because all
motion is horizontal, we can assume there is no net force in the
vertical direction. The problem is therefore one-dimensional along the
horizontal direction. As noted, $\textbf{f}{}$ opposes the motion and is
thus in the opposite direction of
*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*$\textbf{F}_{\text{floor}}{}$. Note that
we do not include the forces $\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}$ or
$\textbf{F}_{\text{cart}}{}$ because these are internal forces, and we
do not include $\textbf{F}_{\text{foot}}{}$ because it acts on the
floor, not on the system. There are no other significant forces acting
on System 1. If the net external force can be found from all this
information, we can use Newton's second law to find the acceleration as
requested. See the free-body diagram in the figure.

[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

None of the forces between components of System 1, such as between the
professor's hands and the cart, contribute to the net external force
because they are internal to System 1. Another way to look at this is to
note that forces between components of a system cancel because they are
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, the force
exerted by the professor on the cart results in an equal and opposite
force back on her. In this case both forces act on the same system and,
therefore, cancel. Thus internal forces (between components of a system)
cancel. Choosing System 1 was crucial to solving this problem.

Force on the Cart---Choosing a New System
:::

Calculate the force the professor exerts on the cart in
[link](#import-auto-id2324690){.autogenerated-content} using data from
the previous example if needed.

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

If we now define the system of interest to be the cart plus equipment
(System 2 in [link](#import-auto-id2324690){.autogenerated-content}),
then the net external force on System 2 is the force the professor
exerts on the cart minus friction. The force she exerts on the cart,
$\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}$, is an external force acting on System 2.
$\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}$ was internal to System 1, but it is
external to System 2 and will enter Newton's second law for System 2.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

Newton's second law can be used to find $\textbf{F}_{\text{prof}}{}$.
Starting with

::: {#eip-id1949236 data-type="equation"}
$${a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m}}{}$$
:::

and noting that the magnitude of the net external force on System 2 is

::: {#eip-id2390884 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = {F_{\text{prof}} - f}},$$
:::

we solve for $F_{\text{prof}}{}$, the desired quantity:

::: {#eip-id1373488 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{prof}} = {F_{\text{net}} + f.}}{}$$
:::

The value of $f{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* is given, so we must
calculate net $F_{\text{net}}{}$. That can be done since both the
acceleration and mass of System 2 are known. Using Newton's second law
we see that

::: {#eip-id2367884 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}},$$
:::

where the mass of System 2 is 19.0 kg
($m{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*= 12.0 kg + 7.0 kg) and its
acceleration was found to be ${{a = 1.5\ }\text{m/s}^{2}}{}$ in the
previous example. Thus,

::: {#eip-id3477001 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{net}} = \text{ma}},$$
:::

::: {#eip-id1454423 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{net}} = (}\text{19}\text{.}\text{0\ kg})(1.5\ \text{m/s}^{2}{) = \text{29\ N}}}.$$
:::

Now we can find the desired force:

::: {#eip-id1004496 data-type="equation"}
$${F_{\text{prof}} = {F_{\text{net}} + f}},$$
:::

::: {#eip-id1197329 data-type="equation"}
$${{F_{\text{prof}} = \text{29\ N}}{+ \text{24.0\ N} = \text{53\ N}}}.$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

It is interesting that this force is significantly less than the 150-N
force the professor exerted backward on the floor. Not all of that 150-N
force is transmitted to the cart; some of it accelerates the professor.

The choice of a system is an important analytical step both in solving
problems and in thoroughly understanding the physics of the situation
(which is not necessarily the same thing).

Since $m = F/a$, the parachutist has a mass of
$539\,\text{N/9}\text{.8~km/s}^{\text{2}} = 55\,\text{kg}$.

For the first 2 s, the parachutist accelerates at 9.8 m/s^2^.

$$\begin{matrix}

Her speed after 2 s is 19.6 m/s.

From 2 s to 10 s, the net force on the parachutist is 539 N -- 615 N, or
76 N upward.

$\begin{matrix}

### Section Summary { data-type="title"}

-   [Newton's third law of motion]{data-type="term"} represents a basic
    symmetry in nature. It states: Whenever one body exerts a force on a
    second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in
    magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that the first body
    exerts.
-   A [thrust]{data-type="term"} is a reaction force that pushes a body
    forward in response to a backward force. Rockets, airplanes, and
    cars are pushed forward by a thrust reaction force.

When you take off in a jet aircraft, there is a sensation of being
pushed back into the seat. Explain why you move backward in the
seat---is there really a force backward on you? (The same reasoning
explains whiplash injuries, in which the head is apparently thrown
backward.)

A device used since the 1940s to measure the kick or recoil of the body
due to heart beats is the "ballistocardiograph." What physics
principle(s) are involved here to measure the force of cardiac
contraction? How might we construct such a device?

Why does an ordinary rifle recoil (kick backward) when fired? The barrel
of a recoilless rifle is open at both ends. Describe how Newton's third
law applies when one is fired. Can you safely stand close behind one
when it is fired?

An American football lineman reasons that it is senseless to try to
out-push the opposing player, since no matter how hard he pushes he will
experience an equal and opposite force from the other player. Use
Newton's laws and draw a free-body diagram of an appropriate system to
explain how he can still out-push the opposition if he is strong enough.

Newton's third law of motion tells us that forces always occur in pairs
of equal and opposite magnitude. Explain how the choice of the "system
of interest" affects whether one such pair of forces cancels.

A brave but inadequate rugby player is being pushed backward by an
opposing player who is exerting a force of 800 N on him. The mass of the
losing player plus equipment is 90.0 kg, and he is accelerating at
${1\text{.}\text{20}\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}$ backward. (a) What is the force
of friction between the losing player's feet and the grass? (b) What
force does the winning player exert on the ground to move forward if his
mass plus equipment is 110 kg? (c) Draw a sketch of the situation
showing the system of interest used to solve each part. For this
situation, draw a free-body diagram and write the net force equation.

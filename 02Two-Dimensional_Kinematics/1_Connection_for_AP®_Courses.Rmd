![Everyday motion that we experience is, thankfully, rarely as tortuous
as a rollercoaster ride like this---the Dragon Khan in Spain\'s
Universal Port Aventura Amusement Park. However, most motion is in
curved, rather than straight-line, paths. Motion along a curved path is
two- or three-dimensional motion, and can be described in a similar
fashion to one-dimensional motion. (credit: Boris23/Wikimedia

Most instances of motion in everyday life involve changes in
displacement and velocity that occur in more than one direction. For
example, when you take a long road trip, you drive on different roads in
different directions for different amounts of time at different speeds.
How can these motions all be combined to determine information about the
trip such as the total displacement and average velocity? If you kick a
ball from ground level at some angle above the horizontal, how can you
describe its motion? To what maximum height does the object rise above
the ground? How long is the object in the air? How much horizontal
distance is covered before the ball lands? To answer questions such as
these, we need to describe motion in two dimensions.

Examining two-dimensional motion requires an understanding of both the
scalar and the vector quantities associated with the motion. You will
learn how to combine vectors to incorporate both the magnitude and
direction of vectors into your analysis. You will learn strategies for
simplifying the calculations involved by choosing the appropriate
reference frame and by treating each dimension of the motion separately
as a one-dimensional problem, but you will also see that the motion
itself occurs in the same way regardless of your chosen reference frame
(Essential Knowledge 3.A.1).

This chapter lays a necessary foundation for examining interactions of
objects described by forces (Big Idea 3). Changes in direction result
from acceleration, which necessitates force on an object. In this
chapter, you will concentrate on describing motion that involves changes
in direction. In later chapters, you will apply this understanding as
you learn about how forces cause these motions (Enduring Understanding
3.A). The concepts in this chapter support:

**Big Idea 3** The interactions of an object with other objects can be
described by forces.

Enduring Understanding 3.A All forces share certain common
characteristics when considered by observers in inertial reference
frames.

Essential Knowledge 3.A.1 An observer in a particular reference frame
can describe the motion of an object using such quantities as position,
displacement, distance, velocity, speed, and acceleration.

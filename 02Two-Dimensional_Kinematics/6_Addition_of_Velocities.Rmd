### Relative Velocity {#relative-velocity data-type="title"}

If a person rows a boat across a rapidly flowing river and tries to head
directly for the other shore, the boat instead moves **diagonally**
relative to the shore, as in
[link](#import-auto-id1635451){.autogenerated-content}. The boat does
not move in the direction in which it is pointed. The reason, of course,
is that the river carries the boat downstream. Similarly, if a small
airplane flies overhead in a strong crosswind, you can sometimes see
that the plane is not moving in the direction in which it is pointed, as
illustrated in [link](#import-auto-id1851600){.autogenerated-content}.
The plane is moving straight ahead relative to the air, but the movement
of the air mass relative to the ground carries it sideways.

![A boat trying to head straight across a river will actually move
diagonally relative to the shore as shown. Its total velocity (solid
arrow) relative to the shore is the sum of its velocity relative to the
river plus the velocity of the river relative to the
shore.](images/Figure_03_05_01a.jpg){#import-auto-id1635451}

![An airplane heading straight north is instead carried to the west and
slowed down by wind. The plane does not move relative to the ground in
the direction it points; rather, it moves in the direction of its total
velocity (solid
arrow).](images/Figure_03_05_02a.jpg){#import-auto-id1851600}

In each of these situations, an object has a
[velocity]{#import-auto-id1831655 data-type="term"} relative to a medium
(such as a river) and that medium has a velocity relative to an observer
on solid ground. The velocity of the object **relative to the observer**
is the sum of these velocity vectors, as indicated in
[link](#import-auto-id1635451){.autogenerated-content} and
[link](#import-auto-id1851600){.autogenerated-content}. These situations
are only two of many in which it is useful to add velocities. In this
module, we first re-examine how to add velocities and then consider
certain aspects of what relative velocity means.

How do we add velocities? Velocity is a vector (it has both magnitude
and direction); the rules of [vector addition]{#import-auto-id1402169
data-type="term"} discussed in [Vector Addition and Subtraction:
Graphical Methods](/m54781) and [Vector Addition and Subtraction:
Analytical Methods](/m54783) apply to the addition of velocities, just
as they do for any other vectors. In one-dimensional motion, the
addition of velocities is simple---they add like ordinary numbers. For
example, if a field hockey player is moving at $\text{5~m/s}{}$ straight
toward the goal and drives the ball in the same direction with a
velocity of $\text{30~m/s}{}$ relative to her body, then the velocity of
the ball is $\text{35~m/s}{}$ relative to the stationary, profusely
sweating goalkeeper standing in front of the goal.

In two-dimensional motion, either graphical or analytical techniques can
be used to add velocities. We will concentrate on analytical techniques.
The following equations give the relationships between the magnitude and
direction of velocity ($v{}$ and $\theta{}$) and its components
($v_{x}{}$ and $v_{y}{}$) along the **x**- and **y**-axes of an
appropriately chosen coordinate system:

::: {#eip-343 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{x} = v}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}{}$$
:::

::: {#eip-859 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{y} = v\ }\text{sin}\ \theta}{}$$
:::

::: {#eip-505 data-type="equation"}
$${v = \sqrt{v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}}}{}$$
:::

::: {#eip-213 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({v_{y}/v_{x}})}.{}$$

![The velocity, $v{}$, of an object traveling at an angle $\theta{}$ to
the horizontal axis is the sum of component vectors $\textbf{v}_{x}{}$
and
$\textbf{v}_{y}{}$.](images/Figure_03_05_03a.jpg){#import-auto-id1382383}

These equations are valid for any vectors and are adapted specifically
for velocity. The first two equations are used to find the components of
a velocity when its magnitude and direction are known. The last two are
used to find the magnitude and direction of velocity when its components
are known.

Take-Home Experiment: Relative Velocity of a Boat

Fill a bathtub half-full of water. Take a toy boat or some other object
that floats in water. Unplug the drain so water starts to drain. Try
pushing the boat from one side of the tub to the other and perpendicular

ends up immediately opposite? Compare the directions of the flow of
water, heading of the boat, and actual velocity of the boat.

Adding Velocities: A Boat on a River
:::

![A boat attempts to travel straight across a river at a speed 0.75 m/s.

right. What is the total displacement of the boat relative to the

Refer to [link](#import-auto-id2070798){.autogenerated-content}, which
shows a boat trying to go straight across the river. Let us calculate
the magnitude and direction of the boat\'s velocity relative to an
observer on the shore, $\textbf{v}_{\text{tot}}{}$. The velocity of the
boat, $\textbf{v}_{\text{boat}}{}$, is 0.75 m/s in the $y{}$-direction
relative to the river and the velocity of the river,
$\textbf{v}_{\text{river}}{}$, is 1.20 m/s to the right.

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

We start by choosing a coordinate system with its $x$-axis parallel to
the velocity of the river, as shown in
[link](#import-auto-id2070798){.autogenerated-content}. Because the boat
is directed straight toward the other shore, its velocity relative to
the water is parallel to the $y$-axis and perpendicular to the velocity
of the river. Thus, we can add the two velocities by using the equations
${v_{\text{tot}} = \sqrt{v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}}}{}$ and
${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({v_{y}/v_{x}})}{}$ directly.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

The magnitude of the total velocity is

::: {#eip-120 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{\text{tot}} = \sqrt{v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}}}\text{,}}{}$$
:::

where

::: {#eip-845 data-type="equation"}
$${{{v_{x} = v_{\text{river}}} = 1}\text{.}\text{20\ m/s}}{}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-311 data-type="equation"}
$${{{v_{y} = v_{\text{boat}}} = 0}\text{.}\text{750\ m/s.}}{}$$
:::

Thus,

::: {#eip-869 data-type="equation"}
$${v_{\text{tot}} = \sqrt{(1\text{.}\text{20\ m/s}{)^{2} + (}0\text{.}\text{750\ m/s})^{2}}}{}$$
:::

yielding

::: {#eip-166 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{\text{tot}} = 1}\text{.}\text{42\ m/s.}}{}$$
:::

The direction of the total velocity $\theta{}$ is given by:

::: {#eip-862 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({v_{y}/v_{x}}{) = \text{tan}^{- 1}}(0\text{.}{\text{750}/1}\text{.}\text{20})}\text{.}{}$$
:::

This equation gives

::: {#eip-16 data-type="equation"}
$${{{\theta = \text{32}}\text{.}0º}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

Both the magnitude $v$ and the direction $\theta$ of the total velocity
are consistent with
[link](#import-auto-id2070798){.autogenerated-content}. Note that
because the velocity of the river is large compared with the velocity of
the boat, it is swept rapidly downstream. This result is evidenced by
the small angle (only $32.0º$) the total velocity has relative to the
riverbank.

Calculating Velocity: Wind Velocity Causes an Airplane to Drift
:::

Calculate the wind velocity for the situation shown in
[link](#import-auto-id1546060){.autogenerated-content}. The plane is
known to be moving at 45.0 m/s due north relative to the air mass, while
its velocity relative to the ground (its total velocity) is 38.0 m/s in
a direction ${\text{20}\text{.0º}}{}$ west of north.

What is the speed and direction of the
wind?](images/Figure_03_05_04a.jpg){#import-auto-id1546060}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

In this problem, somewhat different from the previous example, we know
the total velocity $\textbf{v}_{\text{tot}}$ and that it is the sum of
two other velocities, $\textbf{v}_{\text{w}}{}$ (the wind) and
$\textbf{v}_{\text{p}}{}$ (the plane relative to the air mass). The
quantity $\textbf{v}_{\text{p}}{}$ is known, and we are asked to find
$\textbf{v}_{\text{w}}{}$. None of the velocities are perpendicular, but
it is possible to find their components along a common set of
perpendicular axes. If we can find the components of
$\textbf{v}_{\text{w}}{}$, then we can combine them to solve for its
magnitude and direction. As shown in
[link](#import-auto-id1546060){.autogenerated-content}, we choose a
coordinate system with its *x*-axis due east and its *y*-axis due north
(parallel to $\textbf{v}_{\text{p}}{}$). (You may wish to look back at
the discussion of the addition of vectors using perpendicular components
in [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods](/m54783).)

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

Because $\textbf{v}_{\text{tot}}{}$ is the vector sum of the
$\textbf{v}_{\text{w}}{}$ and $\textbf{v}_{\text{p}}{}$, its *x*- and
*y*-components are the sums of the *x*- and *y*-components of the wind
and plane velocities. Note that the plane only has vertical component of
velocity so ${v_{px} = 0}{}$ and ${v_{py} = v_{\text{p}}}{}$. That is,

::: {#eip-190 data-type="equation"}
$${v_{\text{tot}x} = v_{\text{w}x}}{}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-690 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{\text{tot}y} = {v_{\text{w}y} + v_{\text{p}}}}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

We can use the first of these two equations to find $v_{\text{w}x}{}$:

::: {#eip-615 data-type="equation"}
$${{{{v_{\text{w}x} = v_{\text{tot}x}} = v_{\text{tot}}}\text{cos\ 110º}}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

Because ${v_{\text{tot}} = \text{38}}\text{.}{0\ m/\text{s}}$ and
${\text{cos\ 110º} = –0.342}{}$ we have

::: {#eip-112 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{\text{w}x} = (}\text{38}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s})(\text{–0}\text{.}\text{342})\text{=–13}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s.}}{}$$
:::

The minus sign indicates motion west which is consistent with the
diagram.

Now, to find $v_{\text{w}\text{y}}{}$ we note that

::: {#eip-142 data-type="equation"}
$${v_{\text{tot}y} = {v_{\text{w}y} + v_{\text{p}}}}{}$$
:::

Here ${{{v_{\text{tot}y} =}v_{\text{tot}}}\text{sin~110º}}{}$; thus,

::: {#eip-206 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{\text{w}y} = (}\text{38}\text{.}0\ m/s)(0\text{.}\text{940}{) - \text{45}}\text{.}0\ m/s{= {- 9}}\text{.}\text{29\ m/s.}}{}$$
:::

This minus sign indicates motion south which is consistent with the
diagram.

Now that the perpendicular components of the wind velocity
$v_{\text{w}x}{}$ and $v_{\text{w}y}{}$ are known, we can find the
magnitude and direction of $\textbf{v}_{\text{w}}{}$. First, the
magnitude is

::: {#eip-128 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
v_{\text{w}} & = & \sqrt{v_{\text{w}x}^{2} + v_{\text{w}y}^{2}} \\
 & = & \sqrt{{( - \text{13}}\text{.}0\ m/s{{)^{2} + (} - 9}\text{.}\text{29\ m/s})^{2}} \\
\end{array}$$
:::

so that

::: {#eip-637 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{\text{w}} = \text{16}}\text{.}0\ m/s\text{.}}{}$$
:::

The direction is:

::: {#eip-359 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({v_{\text{w}y}/v_{\text{w}x}}{) = \text{tan}^{- 1}}{( - 9}\text{.}{\text{29}/{- \text{13}}}\text{.}0)}{}$$
:::

giving

::: {#eip-955 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{35}}\text{.}6º}\text{.}{}$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

The wind\'s speed and direction are consistent with the significant
effect the wind has on the total velocity of the plane, as seen in
[link](#import-auto-id1546060){.autogenerated-content}. Because the
plane is fighting a strong combination of crosswind and head-wind, it
ends up with a total velocity significantly less than its velocity
relative to the air mass as well as heading in a different direction.
:::

Note that in both of the last two examples, we were able to make the
mathematics easier by choosing a coordinate system with one axis
parallel to one of the velocities. We will repeatedly find that choosing
an appropriate coordinate system makes problem solving easier. For
example, in projectile motion we always use a coordinate system with one
axis parallel to gravity.

### Relative Velocities and Classical Relativity {#relative-velocities-and-classical-relativity data-type="title"}

When adding velocities, we have been careful to specify that the
**velocity is relative to some reference frame**. These velocities are
called [relative velocities]{#import-auto-id1929302 data-type="term"}.
For example, the velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is
different from its velocity relative to the ground. Both are quite
different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its passengers
(which should be close to zero). Relative velocities are one aspect of
[relativity]{#import-auto-id1982113 data-type="term"}, which is defined
to be the study of how different observers moving relative to each other
measure the same phenomenon.

Nearly everyone has heard of relativity and immediately associates it
with Albert Einstein (1879--1955), the greatest physicist of the 20th
century. Einstein revolutionized our view of nature with his **modern**
theory of relativity, which we shall study in later chapters. The
relative velocities in this section are actually aspects of classical
relativity, first discussed correctly by Galileo and Isaac Newton.
[Classical relativity]{#import-auto-id1447237 data-type="term"} is
limited to situations where speeds are less than about 1% of the speed
of light---that is, less than $\text{3,000~km/s}{}$. Most things we
encounter in daily life move slower than this speed.

Let us consider an example of what two different observers see in a
situation analyzed long ago by Galileo. Suppose a sailor at the top of a
mast on a moving ship drops his binoculars. Where will it hit the deck?
Will it hit at the base of the mast, or will it hit behind the mast
because the ship is moving forward? The answer is that if air resistance
is negligible, the binoculars will hit at the base of the mast at a
point directly below its point of release. Now let us consider what two
different observers see when the binoculars drop. One observer is on the
ship and the other on shore. The binoculars have no horizontal velocity
relative to the observer on the ship, and so he sees them fall straight
down the mast. (See
[link](#import-auto-id1892076){.autogenerated-content}.) To the observer
on shore, the binoculars and the ship have the **same** horizontal
velocity, so both move the same distance forward while the binoculars
are falling. This observer sees the curved path shown in
[link](#import-auto-id1892076){.autogenerated-content}. Although the
paths look different to the different observers, each sees the same
result---the binoculars hit at the base of the mast and not behind it.
To get the correct description, it is crucial to correctly specify the
velocities relative to the observer.

![Classical relativity. The same motion as viewed by two different
observers. An observer on the moving ship sees the binoculars dropped
from the top of its mast fall straight down. An observer on shore sees
the binoculars take the curved path, moving forward with the ship. Both
observers see the binoculars strike the deck at the base of the mast.
The initial horizontal velocity is different relative to the two
observers. (The ship is shown moving rather fast to emphasize the
effect.)](images/Figure_03_05_05.jpg){#import-auto-id1892076}

Calculating Relative Velocity: An Airline Passenger Drops a Coin
:::

An airline passenger drops a coin while the plane is moving at 260 m/s.
What is the velocity of the coin when it strikes the floor 1.50 m below
its point of release: (a) Measured relative to the plane? (b) Measured
relative to the Earth?

![The motion of a coin dropped inside an airplane as viewed by two

straight down. (b) An observer on the ground sees the coin move almost
horizontally.](images/Figure_03_05_06a.jpg){#import-auto-id1944737}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

Both problems can be solved with the techniques for falling objects and
projectiles. In part (a), the initial velocity of the coin is zero
relative to the plane, so the motion is that of a falling object
(one-dimensional). In part (b), the initial velocity is 260 m/s
horizontal relative to the Earth and gravity is vertical, so this motion
is a projectile motion. In both parts, it is best to use a coordinate
system with vertical and horizontal axes.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution for (a)]{data-type="title"}
:::

Using the given information, we note that the initial velocity and
position are zero, and the final position is 1.50 m. The final velocity
can be found using the equation:

::: {#eip-313 data-type="equation"}
$${{{{v_{y}}^{2} = {{v_{0,y}}^{2} - 2g}}({y - y_{0}})}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

Substituting known values into the equation, we get

::: {#eip-444 data-type="equation"}
$${{{v_{y}}^{2} = {0^{2} - 2}}(9\text{.}\text{80}\ \text{m/s}^{2}){( - 1}\text{.}\text{50}\ {\text{m} - 0\ m}{) = \text{29}}\text{.}4\ \text{m}^{2}\text{/s}^{2}}{}$$
:::

yielding

::: {#eip-877 data-type="equation"}
$${{v_{y} = {- 5}}\text{.}\text{42\ m/s.}}{}$$
:::

We know that the square root of 29.4 has two roots: 5.42 and -5.42. We
choose the negative root because we know that the velocity is directed
downwards, and we have defined the positive direction to be upwards.
There is no initial horizontal velocity relative to the plane and no
horizontal acceleration, and so the motion is straight down relative to
the plane.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution for (b)]{data-type="title"}
:::

Because the initial vertical velocity is zero relative to the ground and
vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion, the final vertical
velocity for the coin relative to the ground is
$v_{y} = - 5.42\ \text{m/s}$, the same as found in part (a). In contrast
to part (a), there now is a horizontal component of the velocity.
However, since there is no horizontal acceleration, the initial and
final horizontal velocities are the same and
${v_{x} = \text{260~m/s}}{}$. The *x*- and *y*-components of velocity
can be combined to find the magnitude of the final velocity:

::: {#eip-558 data-type="equation"}
$${v = \sqrt{{v_{x}}^{2} + {v_{y}}^{2}}}\text{.}{}$$
:::

Thus,

::: {#eip-842 data-type="equation"}
$${v = \sqrt{(\text{260\ m/s}{{)^{2} + (} - 5}\text{.}\text{42\ m/s})^{2}}}{}$$
:::

yielding

::: {#eip-98 data-type="equation"}
$${{v = \text{260}}\text{.}\text{06\ m/s.}}{}$$
:::

The direction is given by:

::: {#eip-73 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({v_{y}/v_{x}}{) = \text{tan}^{- 1}}{( - 5}\text{.}{\text{42}/\text{260}})}{}$$
:::

so that

::: {#eip-328 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}{( - 0}\text{.}\text{0208}{) = {- 1}}\text{.}\text{19º}}\text{.}$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

In part (a), the final velocity relative to the plane is the same as it
would be if the coin were dropped from rest on the Earth and fell 1.50
m. This result fits our experience; objects in a plane fall the same way
when the plane is flying horizontally as when it is at rest on the
ground. This result is also true in moving cars. In part (b), an
observer on the ground sees a much different motion for the coin. The
plane is moving so fast horizontally to begin with that its final
velocity is barely greater than the initial velocity. Once again, we see
that in two dimensions, vectors do not add like ordinary numbers---the
final velocity v in part (b) is **not**
${(\text{260\ –\ 5}\text{.}\text{42})\text{~m/s}}{}$; rather, it is
${\text{260}\text{.}\text{06~m/s}}{}$. The velocity\'s magnitude had to
be calculated to five digits to see any difference from that of the
airplane. The motions as seen by different observers (one in the plane
and one on the ground) in this example are analogous to those discussed
for the binoculars dropped from the mast of a moving ship, except that
the velocity of the plane is much larger, so that the two observers see
**very** different paths. (See
[link](#import-auto-id1944737){.autogenerated-content}.) In addition,
both observers see the coin fall 1.50 m vertically, but the one on the
ground also sees it move forward 144 m (this calculation is left for the
reader). Thus, one observer sees a vertical path, the other a nearly
horizontal path.

The great astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that all distant galaxies
are receding from our Milky Way Galaxy with velocities proportional to
their distances. It appears to an observer on the Earth that we are at
the center of an expanding universe.
[link](#import-auto-id1915192){.autogenerated-content} illustrates this
for five galaxies lying along a straight line, with the Milky Way Galaxy
at the center. Using the data from the figure, calculate the velocities:
(a) relative to galaxy 2 and (b) relative to galaxy 5. The results mean
that observers on all galaxies will see themselves at the center of the
expanding universe, and they would likely be aware of relative
velocities, concluding that it is not possible to locate the center of
expansion with the given information.

![Five galaxies on a straight line, showing their distances and
velocities relative to the Milky Way (MW) Galaxy. The distances are in
millions of light years (Mly), where a light year is the distance light
travels in one year. The velocities are nearly proportional to the
distances. The sizes of the galaxies are greatly exaggerated; an average
galaxy is about 0.1 Mly

[Construct Your Own Problem]{data-type="title"} Consider an airplane
headed for a runway in a cross wind. Construct a problem in which you
calculate the angle the airplane must fly relative to the air mass in
order to have a velocity parallel to the runway. Among the things to
consider are the direction of the runway, the wind speed and direction
(its velocity) and the speed of the plane relative to the air mass. Also
calculate the speed of the airplane relative to the ground. Discuss any
last minute maneuvers the pilot might have to perform in order for the
plane to land with its wheels pointing straight down the runway.

</figure><p id="import-auto-id1165298981862">The fact that the straight-line distance (10.3 blocks) in <a href="#import-auto-id1165298535408" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> is less than the total distance walked (14 blocks) is one example of a general characteristic of vectors. (Recall that <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1165298541000">vectors</span> are quantities that have both magnitude and direction.)</p>
<p id="import-auto-id1165298648314">As for one-dimensional kinematics, we use arrows to represent vectors. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector's magnitude. The arrow's length is indicated by hash marks in <a href="#import-auto-id1165296250183" class="autogenerated-content">link</a> and <a href="#import-auto-id1165298535408" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. The arrow points in the same direction as the vector. For two-dimensional motion, the path of an object can be represented with three vectors: one vector shows the straight-line path between the initial and final points of the motion, one vector shows the horizontal component of the motion, and one vector shows the vertical component of the motion. The horizontal and vertical components of the motion add together to give the straight-line path. For example, observe the three vectors in <a href="#import-auto-id1165298535408" class="autogenerated-content">link</a>. The first represents a 9-block displacement east. The second represents a 5-block displacement north. These vectors are added to give the third vector, with a 10.3-block total displacement. The third vector is the straight-line path between the two points. Note that in this example, the vectors that we are adding are perpendicular to each other and thus form a right triangle. This means that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude of the total displacement. (Note that we cannot use the Pythagorean theorem to add vectors that are not perpendicular. We will develop techniques for adding vectors having any direction, not just those perpendicular to one another, in <a href="/m54781">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods</a> and <a href="/m54783">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods</a>.)</p></section>

It is also true of more complicated motion involving movement in two directions at once. For example, let's compare the motions of two baseballs. One baseball is dropped from rest. At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same height and follows a curved path. A stroboscope has captured the positions of the balls at fixed time intervals as they fall.</p>

<p id="fs-id1121791">Design an experiment to confirm what is shown in <a href="#import-auto-id1165296248287">Figure 3.6</a>, that the vertical motion of the two balls is independent of the horizontal motion. As you think about your experiment, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul id="fs-id1460417"><li>How will you measure the horizontal and vertical positions of each ball over time? What equipment will this require?</li>
<li>How will you measure the time interval between each of your position measurements? What equipment will this require?</li>
<li>If you were to create separate graphs of the horizontal velocity for each ball versus time, what do you predict it would look like? Explain.</li>
<li>If you were to compare graphs of the vertical velocity for each ball versus time, what do you predict it would look like? Explain.</li>
<li>If there is a significant amount of air resistance, how will that affect each of your graphs?</li>
</ul><p id="fs-id1494693">Design a two-dimensional ballistic motion experiment that demonstrates the relationship between the maximum height reached by an object and the object's time of flight. As you think about your experiment, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul id="fs-id1335504"><li>How will you measure the maximum height reached by your object?</li>
<li>How can you take advantage of the symmetry of an object in ballistic motion launched from ground level, reaching maximum height, and returning to ground level?</li>
<li>Will it make a difference if your object has no horizontal component to its velocity? Explain.</li>
<li>Will you need to measure the time at multiple different positions? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Predict what a graph of travel time versus maximum height will look like. Will it be linear? Parabolic? Horizontal? Explain the shape of your predicted graph qualitatively or quantitatively.</li>
<li>If there is a significant amount of air resistance, how will that affect your measurements and your results?</li>
</ul></div><p id="import-auto-id1165298681613">It is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity implies that the vertical motion is independent of whether or not the ball is moving horizontally. (Assuming no air resistance, the vertical motion of a falling object is influenced by gravity only, and not by any horizontal forces.) Careful examination of the ball thrown horizontally shows that it travels the same horizontal distance between flashes. This is due to the fact that there are no additional forces on the ball in the horizontal direction after it is thrown. This result means that the horizontal velocity is constant, and affected neither by vertical motion nor by gravity (which is vertical). Note that this case is true only for ideal conditions. In the real world, air resistance will affect the speed of the balls in both directions.</p>
<p id="import-auto-id1165296226966">The two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is composed of two independent one-dimensional motions (horizontal and vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called <em data-effect="italics"><em data-effect="italics">projectile motion</em></em>, is to <em data-effect="italics"><em data-effect="italics">resolve</em></em> (break) it into motions along perpendicular directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular components is possible because the components are independent. We shall see how to resolve vectors in <a href="/m54781">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods</a> and <a href="/m54783">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods</a>.

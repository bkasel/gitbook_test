### Two-Dimensional Motion: Walking in a City {#two-dimensional-motion-walking-in-a-city data-type="title"}

Suppose you want to walk from one point to another in a city with
uniform square blocks, as pictured in
[link](#import-auto-id1165296250183){.autogenerated-content}.

![A pedestrian walks a two-dimensional path between two points in a
city. In this scene, all blocks are square and are the same
size.](images/Figure_03_01_01.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296250183}

The straight-line path that a helicopter might fly is blocked to you as
a pedestrian, and so you are forced to take a two-dimensional path, such
as the one shown. You walk 14 blocks in all, 9 east followed by 5 north.
What is the straight-line distance?

An old adage states that the shortest distance between two points is a
straight line. The two legs of the trip and the straight-line path form
a right triangle, and so the Pythagorean theorem,
${a^{2}\text{~+~}b^{2}\text{~=~}c^{2}}{}$, can be used to find the
straight-line distance.

![The Pythagorean theorem relates the length of the legs of a right
triangle, labeled $a{}$ and $b{}$, with the hypotenuse, labeled $c{}$.
The relationship is given by: ${a^{2}\text{+~}b^{2}\text{=~}c^{2}}{}$.
This can be rewritten, solving for $c{}$ :
${c\text{~=~}\sqrt{a^{2}\text{+~}b^{2}}}{}$.](images/Figure_03_01_02.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298608693}

The hypotenuse of the triangle is the straight-line path, and so in this
case its length in units of city blocks is
${\sqrt{(\text{9\ blocks})^{2}\text{+~}(\text{5\ blocks})^{2}}\text{=~10}\text{.}\text{3\ blocks}}{}$,
considerably shorter than the 14 blocks you walked. (Note that we are
using three significant figures in the answer. Although it appears that
"9" and "5" have only one significant digit, they are discrete numbers.
In this case "9 blocks" is the same as "9.0 or 9.00 blocks." We have
decided to use three significant figures in the answer in order to show
the result more precisely.)

![The straight-line path followed by a helicopter between the two points
is shorter than the 14 blocks walked by the pedestrian. All blocks are
square and the same
size.](images/Figure_03_01_03.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298535408}

The fact that the straight-line distance (10.3 blocks) in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298535408){.autogenerated-content} is less
than the total distance walked (14 blocks) is one example of a general
characteristic of vectors. (Recall that
[vectors]{#import-auto-id1165298541000 data-type="term"} are quantities
that have both magnitude and direction.)

As for one-dimensional kinematics, we use arrows to represent vectors.
The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector\'s magnitude. The
arrow\'s length is indicated by hash marks in
[link](#import-auto-id1165296250183){.autogenerated-content} and
[link](#import-auto-id1165298535408){.autogenerated-content}. The arrow
points in the same direction as the vector. For two-dimensional motion,
the path of an object can be represented with three vectors: one vector
shows the straight-line path between the initial and final points of the
motion, one vector shows the horizontal component of the motion, and one
vector shows the vertical component of the motion. The horizontal and
vertical components of the motion add together to give the straight-line
path. For example, observe the three vectors in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298535408){.autogenerated-content}. The first
represents a 9-block displacement east. The second represents a 5-block
displacement north. These vectors are added to give the third vector,
with a 10.3-block total displacement. The third vector is the
straight-line path between the two points. Note that in this example,
the vectors that we are adding are perpendicular to each other and thus
form a right triangle. This means that we can use the Pythagorean
theorem to calculate the magnitude of the total displacement. (Note that
we cannot use the Pythagorean theorem to add vectors that are not
perpendicular. We will develop techniques for adding vectors having any
direction, not just those perpendicular to one another, in [Vector
Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods](/m54781) and [Vector
Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods](/m54783).)

### The Independence of Perpendicular Motions {#the-independence-of-perpendicular-motions data-type="title"}

The person taking the path shown in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298535408){.autogenerated-content} walks east
and then north (two perpendicular directions). How far he or she walks
east is only affected by his or her motion eastward. Similarly, how far
he or she walks north is only affected by his or her motion northward.

::: {data-type="title"}
Independence of Motion
:::

The horizontal and vertical components of two-dimensional motion are
independent of each other. Any motion in the horizontal direction does
not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.
:::

This is true in a simple scenario like that of walking in one direction
first, followed by another. It is also true of more complicated motion
involving movement in two directions at once. For example, let\'s
compare the motions of two baseballs. One baseball is dropped from rest.
At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same height
and follows a curved path. A stroboscope has captured the positions of
the balls at fixed time intervals as they fall.

![This shows the motions of two identical balls---one falls from rest,
the other has an initial horizontal velocity. Each subsequent position
is an equal time interval. Arrows represent horizontal and vertical
velocities at each position. The ball on the right has an initial
horizontal velocity, while the ball on the left has no horizontal
velocity. Despite the difference in horizontal velocities, the vertical
velocities and positions are identical for both balls. This shows that
the vertical and horizontal motions are
independent.](images/Figure_03_01_04a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296248287}

Applying the Science Practices: Independence of Horizontal and Vertical
Motion or Maximum Height and Flight Time
:::

Choose one of the following experiments to design:

Design an experiment to confirm what is shown in [Figure
3.6](#import-auto-id1165296248287), that the vertical motion of the two
balls is independent of the horizontal motion. As you think about your
experiment, consider the following questions:

-   How will you measure the horizontal and vertical positions of each
    ball over time? What equipment will this require?
-   How will you measure the time interval between each of your position
    measurements? What equipment will this require?
-   If you were to create separate graphs of the horizontal velocity for
    each ball versus time, what do you predict it would look like?
    Explain.
-   If you were to compare graphs of the vertical velocity for each ball
    versus time, what do you predict it would look like? Explain.
-   If there is a significant amount of air resistance, how will that
    affect each of your graphs?

Design a two-dimensional ballistic motion experiment that demonstrates
the relationship between the maximum height reached by an object and the
object\'s time of flight. As you think about your experiment, consider
the following questions:

-   How will you measure the maximum height reached by your object?
-   How can you take advantage of the symmetry of an object in ballistic
    motion launched from ground level, reaching maximum height, and
    returning to ground level?
-   Will it make a difference if your object has no horizontal component
    to its velocity? Explain.
-   Will you need to measure the time at multiple different positions?
    Why or why not?
-   Predict what a graph of travel time versus maximum height will look
    like. Will it be linear? Parabolic? Horizontal? Explain the shape of
    your predicted graph qualitatively or quantitatively.
-   If there is a significant amount of air resistance, how will that
    affect your measurements and your results?
:::

It is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical
positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity implies that
the vertical motion is independent of whether or not the ball is moving
horizontally. (Assuming no air resistance, the vertical motion of a
falling object is influenced by gravity only, and not by any horizontal
forces.) Careful examination of the ball thrown horizontally shows that
it travels the same horizontal distance between flashes. This is due to
the fact that there are no additional forces on the ball in the
horizontal direction after it is thrown. This result means that the
horizontal velocity is constant, and affected neither by vertical motion
nor by gravity (which is vertical). Note that this case is true only for
ideal conditions. In the real world, air resistance will affect the
speed of the balls in both directions.

The two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is
composed of two independent one-dimensional motions (horizontal and
vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called **projectile
motion**, is to **resolve** (break) it into motions along perpendicular
directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular
components is possible because the components are independent. We shall
see how to resolve vectors in [Vector Addition and Subtraction:
Graphical Methods](/m54781) and [Vector Addition and Subtraction:
Analytical Methods](/m54783). We will find such techniques to be useful
in many areas of physics.

A student wishes to design an experiment to show that the acceleration
of an object is independent of the object\'s velocity. To do this, ball
A is launched horizontally with some initial speed at an elevation 1.5
meters above the ground, ball B is dropped from rest 1.5 meters above
the ground, and ball C is launched vertically with some initial speed at
an elevation 1.5 meters above the ground. What information would the
student need to collect about each ball in order to test the hypothesis?
:::

::: {#fs-id1414446 data-type="solution"}
We would need to know the horizontal and vertical positions of each ball
at several times. From that data, we could deduce the velocities over
several time intervals and also the accelerations (both horizontal and
vertical) for each ball over several time intervals.

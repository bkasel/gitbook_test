### Vectors in Two Dimensions {#vectors-in-two-dimensions data-type="title"}

A [vector]{#import-auto-id1165296389850 data-type="term"} is a quantity
that has magnitude and direction. Displacement, velocity, acceleration,
and force, for example, are all vectors. In one-dimensional, or
straight-line, motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by
a plus or minus sign. In two dimensions (2-d), however, we specify the
direction of a vector relative to some reference frame (i.e., coordinate
system), using an arrow having length proportional to the vector\'s
magnitude and pointing in the direction of the vector.

[link](#import-auto-id1165298666909){.autogenerated-content} shows such
a *graphical representation of a vector*, using as an example the total
displacement for the person walking in a city considered in [Kinematics
in Two Dimensions: An Introduction](/m54779). We shall use the notation
that a boldface symbol, such as $\text{D}{}$, stands for a vector. Its
magnitude is represented by the symbol in italics, $D{}$, and its
direction by $\theta{}$.

Vectors in this Text
:::

In this text, we will represent a vector with a boldface variable. For
example, we will represent the quantity force with the vector
$\text{F}{}$, which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of
the vector will be represented by a variable in italics, such as $F{}$,
and the direction of the variable will be given by an angle $\theta{}$.

relative to the east-west axis. The length $D{}$ of the arrow is
proportional to the vector\'s magnitude and is measured along the line

### Vector Addition: Head-to-Tail Method {#vector-addition-head-to-tail-method data-type="title"}

The [head-to-tail method]{#import-auto-id1165298552505 data-type="term"}
is a graphical way to add vectors, described in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298643218){.autogenerated-content} below and
in the steps following. The [tail]{#import-auto-id1165298535408
data-type="term"} of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and
the [head]{#import-auto-id1165298982372 data-type="term"} (or tip) of a
vector is the final, pointed end of the arrow.

![**Head-to-Tail Method:** The head-to-tail method of graphically adding
vectors is illustrated for the two displacements of the person walking
in a city considered in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298666909){.autogenerated-content}. (a) Draw a
vector representing the displacement to the east. (b) Draw a vector
representing the displacement to the north. The tail of this vector
should originate from the head of the first, east-pointing vector. (c)
Draw a line from the tail of the east-pointing vector to the head of the
north-pointing vector to form the sum or [resultant
vector]{data-type="term"} $\text{D}{}$. The length of the arrow
$\text{D}{}$ is proportional to the vector\'s magnitude and is measured
to be 10.3 units . Its direction, described as the angle with respect to
the east (or horizontal axis) $\theta{}$ is measured with a protractor
to be
${\text{29}\text{.}1{^\circ}}{}$.](images/Figure_03_02_03.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298643218}

***Step 1.*** **Draw an arrow to represent the first vector (9 blocks to
the east) using a ruler and protractor**.

![](images/Figure_03_02_04a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298876451}

***Step 2.*** Now draw an arrow to represent the second vector (5 blocks
to the north). *Place the tail of the second vector at the head of the
first vector*.

![](images/Figure_03_02_05a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298818267}

***Step 3.*** *If there are more than two vectors, continue this process
for each vector to be added. Note that in our example, we have only two
vectors, so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail*.

***Step 4.*** *Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the
head of the last vector*. This is the
[resultant]{#import-auto-id1165296311722 data-type="term"}, or the sum,
of the other vectors.

![](images/Figure_03_02_06a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165299000967}

***Step 5.*** To get the [magnitude]{#import-auto-id1165298794109
data-type="term"} of the resultant, *measure its length with a ruler.
(Note that in most calculations, we will use the Pythagorean theorem to
determine this length.)*

***Step 6.*** To get the [direction]{#import-auto-id1165298932041
data-type="term"} of the resultant, **measure the angle it makes with
the reference frame using a protractor. (Note that in most calculations,
we will use trigonometric relationships to determine this angle.)**

The graphical addition of vectors is limited in accuracy only by the
precision with which the drawings can be made and the precision of the
measuring tools. It is valid for any number of vectors.

Adding Vectors Graphically Using the Head-to-Tail Method: A Woman Takes
a Walk
:::

Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total
displacement of a person who walks the following three paths
(displacements) on a flat field. First, she walks 25.0 m in a direction
$\text{49.0°}{}$ north of east. Then, she walks 23.0 m heading
$\text{15.0°}{}$ north of east. Finally, she turns and walks 32.0 m in a
direction 68.0° south of east.

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

Represent each displacement vector graphically with an arrow, labeling
the first $\text{A}{}$, the second $\text{B}{}$, and the third
$\text{C}{}$, making the lengths proportional to the distance and the
directions as specified relative to an east-west line. The head-to-tail
method outlined above will give a way to determine the magnitude and
direction of the resultant displacement, denoted $\textbf{R}{}$.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

\(1\) Draw the three displacement vectors.

![](images/Figure_03_02_08.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296232338}

\(2\) Place the vectors head to tail retaining both their initial
magnitude and direction.

![](images/Figure_03_02_09.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298788198}

\(3\) Draw the resultant vector, $\text{R}{}$.

![](images/Figure_03_02_10.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298786300}

\(4\) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of $\textbf{R}{}$, and a
protractor to measure the direction of $\text{R}{}$. While the direction
of the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to
measure the angle between the vector and the nearest horizontal or
vertical axis. Since the resultant vector is south of the eastward
pointing axis, we flip the protractor upside down and measure the angle
between the eastward axis and the vector.

![](images/Figure_03_02_11a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298931707}

In this case, the total displacement $\textbf{R}{}$ is seen to have a
magnitude of 50.0 m and to lie in a direction $7.0{^\circ}{}$ south of
east. By using its magnitude and direction, this vector can be expressed
as ${R = \text{50.0\ m}}{}$ and ${{\theta = 7}\text{.}\text{0°}}{}$
south of east.

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any
number of vectors. It is also important to note that the resultant is
independent of the order in which the vectors are added. Therefore, we
could add the vectors in any order as illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298931858){.autogenerated-content} and we will
still get the same solution.

![](images/Figure_03_02_12.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298931858}

Here, we see that when the same vectors are added in a different order,
the result is the same. This characteristic is true in every case and is
an important characteristic of vectors. Vector addition is
[commutative]{data-type="term"}. Vectors can be added in any order.

::: {#eip-376 data-type="equation"}
$${\textbf{A} + \textbf{B} = \textbf{B} + \textbf{A}}{}\text{.}$$
:::

(This is true for the addition of ordinary numbers as well---you get the
same result whether you add ${\textbf{2} + \textbf{3}}{}$ or
${\textbf{3} + \textbf{2}}{}$, for example).

::: {#fs-id1165298779158 depth="1"}
### Vector Subtraction {#vector-subtraction data-type="title"}

Vector subtraction is a straightforward extension of vector addition. To
define subtraction (say we want to subtract $\textbf{B}$ from
$\textbf{A}$ , written $\textbf{A}–\textbf{B}$ , we must first define
what we mean by subtraction. The *negative* of a vector $\textbf{B}{}$
is defined to be $\textbf{–B}$; that is, graphically *the negative of
any vector has the same magnitude but the opposite direction*, as shown
in [link](#import-auto-id1165298692950){.autogenerated-content}. In
other words, $\textbf{B}{}$ has the same length as $\textbf{–B}{}$, but
points in the opposite direction. Essentially, we just flip the vector
so it points in the opposite direction.

![The negative of a vector is just another vector of the same magnitude
but pointing in the opposite direction. So $\textbf{B}{}$ is the
negative of $\textbf{–B}{}$; it has the same length but opposite
direction.](images/Figure_03_02_13a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298692950}

The **subtraction** of vector $\textbf{B}{}$ from vector $\textbf{A}{}$
is then simply defined to be the addition of $\textbf{–B}{}$ to
$\textbf{A}{}$. Note that vector subtraction is the addition of a
negative vector. The order of subtraction does not affect the results.

::: {#eip-454 data-type="equation"}
$${\text{A~–~B~=~A~+~}(\text{–B})}{}\text{.}$$
:::

This is analogous to the subtraction of scalars (where, for example,
${\text{5~–~2~=~5~+~}(\text{–2})}{}$). Again, the result is independent
of the order in which the subtraction is made. When vectors are
subtracted graphically, the techniques outlined above are used, as the
following example illustrates.

Subtracting Vectors Graphically: A Woman Sailing a Boat
:::

A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The
instructions read to first sail 27.5 m in a direction $\text{66.0°}{}$
north of east from her current location, and then travel 30.0 m in a
direction $\text{112°}$ north of east (or $\text{22.0°}{}$ west of
north). If the woman makes a mistake and travels in the **opposite**
direction for the second leg of the trip, where will she end up? Compare
this location with the location of the dock.

![](images/Figure_03_02_14.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296408744}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector $\textbf{A}$,
and the second leg of the trip with a vector $\textbf{B}{}$. The dock is
located at a location ${\textbf{A} + \textbf{B}}{}$. If the woman
mistakenly travels in the *opposite* direction for the second leg of the
journey, she will travel a distance $B$ (30.0 m) in the direction
${180{^\circ}–112{^\circ} = 68{^\circ}}{}$ south of east. We represent
this as $\textbf{–B}{}$, as shown below. The vector $\textbf{–B}$ has
the same magnitude as $\textbf{B}$ but is in the opposite direction.
Thus, she will end up at a location ${\textbf{A} +}(\textbf{–B})$, or
${\textbf{A}–\textbf{B}}{}$.

![](images/Figure_03_02_15a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296408745}

We will perform vector addition to compare the location of the dock,
${\text{A~}\text{+~}\mathbf{B}}{}$, with the location at which the woman
mistakenly arrives, ${\text{A~+~}(\text{–B})}{}$.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

\(1\) To determine the location at which the woman arrives by accident,
draw vectors $\textbf{A}{}$ and $\textbf{–B}{}$.

\(2\) Place the vectors head to tail.

\(3\) Draw the resultant vector $\mathbf{R}{}$.

\(4\) Use a ruler and protractor to measure the magnitude and direction
of $\mathbf{R}{}$.

![](images/Figure_03_02_16a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298476927}

In this case, ${R = \text{23}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}{}$ and
${{\theta = 7}\text{.}\text{5°}}{}$ south of east.

\(5\) To determine the location of the dock, we repeat this method to
add vectors $\textbf{A}{}$ and $\textbf{B}{}$. We obtain the resultant
vector ${\textbf{R}'}{}$:

![](images/Figure_03_02_17a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296298190}

In this case $R\text{~=~52.9\ m}$ and ${\theta = \text{90.1°}}{}$
 north of east.

We can see that the woman will end up a significant distance from the
dock if she travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the
trip.

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of a vector with
the opposite direction, the graphical method of subtracting vectors
works the same as for addition.

### Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars {#multiplication-of-vectors-and-scalars data-type="title"}

If we decided to walk three times as far on the first leg of the trip
considered in the preceding example, then we would walk
${{\text{3~} \times \text{~27}}\text{.}\text{5\ m}}{}$, or 82.5 m, in a
direction ${\text{66}\text{.}0\text{°}}{}$ north of east. This is an
example of multiplying a vector by a positive
[scalar]{#import-auto-id1165296219603 data-type="term"}. Notice that the
magnitude changes, but the direction stays the same.

If the scalar is negative, then multiplying a vector by it changes the
vector\'s magnitude and gives the new vector the **opposite** direction.
For example, if you multiply by --2, the magnitude doubles but the
direction changes. We can summarize these rules in the following way:
When vector $\mathbf{A}{}$ is multiplied by a scalar $c{}$,

-   [the magnitude of the vector becomes the absolute value of
    $c{}$$A{}$,]{#import-auto-id1165298651742}
-   [if $c{}$ is positive, the direction of the vector does not
    change,]{#import-auto-id1165298881521}
-   [if $c{}$ is negative, the direction is
    reversed.]{#import-auto-id1165298455414}

In our case, $c = 3$ and $A = 27.5\ m$. Vectors are multiplied by
scalars in many situations. Note that division is the inverse of
multiplication. For example, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by
the value (1/2). The rules for multiplication of vectors by scalars are
the same for division; simply treat the divisor as a scalar between 0
and 1.

### Resolving a Vector into Components {#resolving-a-vector-into-components data-type="title"}

In the examples above, we have been adding vectors to determine the
resultant vector. In many cases, however, we will need to do the
opposite. We will need to take a single vector and find what other
vectors added together produce it. In most cases, this involves
determining the perpendicular [components ]{#import-auto-id1165298555736
data-type="term"}of a single vector, for example the **x**- *and*
**y**-components, or the north-south and east-west components.

For example, we may know that the total displacement of a person walking
in a city is 10.3 blocks in a direction $\text{29}\text{.0°}$ north of
east and want to find out how many blocks east and north had to be
walked. This method is called **finding the components (or parts)** of
the displacement in the east and north directions, and it is the inverse
of the process followed to find the total displacement. It is one
example of finding the components of a vector. There are many
applications in physics where this is a useful thing to do. We will see
this soon in [Projectile Motion](/m54787), and much more when we cover
**forces** in [Dynamics: Newton\'s Laws of Motion](/m54802). Most of
these involve finding components along perpendicular axes (such as north
and east), so that right triangles are involved. The analytical
techniques presented in [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical
Methods](/m54783) are ideal for finding vector components.

Two campers in a national park hike from their cabin to the same spot on
a lake, each taking a different path, as illustrated below. The total
distance traveled along Path 1 is 7.5 km, and that along Path 2 is 8.2
km. What is the final displacement of each camper?

Suppose you take two steps $\textbf{A}$ and $\textbf{B}$ (that is, two
nonzero displacements). Under what circumstances can you end up at your
starting point? More generally, under what circumstances can two nonzero
vectors add to give zero? Is the maximum distance you can end up from
the starting point $\textbf{A} + \textbf{B}$ the sum of the lengths of
the two steps?

Suppose you walk 18.0 m straight west and then 25.0 m straight north.
How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass
direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final
position? (If you represent the two legs of the walk as vector
displacements $\textbf{A}{}$ and $\textbf{B}{}$, as in
[link](#import-auto-id1165296241785){.autogenerated-content}, then this
problem asks you to find their sum
${\textbf{R} = \textbf{A} + \textbf{B}}{}$.)

Repeat the problem above, but reverse the order of the two legs of the
walk; show that you get the same final result. That is, you first walk
leg $\mathbf{B}{}$, which is 20.0 m in a direction exactly
$\text{40°}{}$ south of west, and then leg $\mathbf{A}{}$, which is 12.0
m in a direction exactly $\text{20°}{}$ west of north. (This problem
shows that ${{\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}} = {\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A}}}{}$.)

\(a\) Repeat the problem two problems prior, but for the second leg you
walk 20.0 m in a direction $\text{40.0°}{}$ north of east (which is
equivalent to subtracting $\textbf{B}{}$ from $\mathbf{A}{}$ ---that is,
to finding ${{\textbf{R}\prime} = {\textbf{A} - \textbf{B}}}{}$). (b)
Repeat the problem two problems prior, but now you first walk 20.0 m in
a direction $\text{40.0°}{}$ south of west and then 12.0 m in a
direction $\text{20.0°}{}$ east of south (which is equivalent to
subtracting $\textbf{A}{}$ from $\textbf{B}{}$ ---that is, to finding
${\textbf{R}\operatorname{\prime\prime} = \textbf{B} - \textbf{A} = - \textbf{R}\prime}{}$).

component (of a 2-d vector)
:   a piece of a vector that points in either the vertical or the
    horizontal direction; every 2-d vector can be expressed as a sum of
    two vertical and horizontal vector components

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

commutative
:   refers to the interchangeability of order in a function; vector
    addition is commutative because the order in which vectors are added
    together does not affect the final sum

```

direction (of a vector)
:   the orientation of a vector in space

```{=html}

```

head (of a vector)
:   the end point of a vector; the location of the tip of the vector\'s
    arrowhead; also referred to as the "tip"

```{=html}

```

head-to-tail method
:   a method of adding vectors in which the tail of each vector is
    placed at the head of the previous vector

```{=html}

[Analytical methods]{#import-auto-id1165298770648 data-type="term"} of
vector addition and subtraction employ geometry and simple trigonometry
rather than the ruler and protractor of graphical methods. Part of the
graphical technique is retained, because vectors are still represented
by arrows for easy visualization. However, analytical methods are more
concise, accurate, and precise than graphical methods, which are limited
by the accuracy with which a drawing can be made. Analytical methods are
limited only by the accuracy and precision with which physical
quantities are known.

### Resolving a Vector into Perpendicular Components {#resolving-a-vector-into-perpendicular-components data-type="title"}

Analytical techniques and right triangles go hand-in-hand in physics
because (among other things) motions along perpendicular directions are
independent. We very often need to separate a vector into perpendicular
components. For example, given a vector like $\mathbf{A}{}$ in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298677803){.autogenerated-content}, we may
wish to find which two perpendicular vectors, $\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$ and
$\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$, add to produce it.

![The vector $\mathbf{A}{}$, with its tail at the origin of an *x*,
*y*-coordinate system, is shown together with its *x*- and
*y*-components, $\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$ and $\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$. These vectors
form a right triangle. The analytical relationships among these vectors
are summarized
below.](images/Figure_03_03_01a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298677803}

$\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$ and $\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$ are defined to be the
components of *`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*$\mathbf{A}{}$ along the
**x**- and **y**-axes. The three vectors $\mathbf{A}{}$,
$\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$, and $\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$ form a right triangle:

::: {#eip-680 data-type="equation"}
$${{\mathbf{A}_{x}\text{~+~A}_{y}\text{~=~A}}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

Note that this relationship between vector components and the resultant
vector holds only for vector quantities (which include both magnitude
and direction). The relationship does not apply for the magnitudes
alone. For example, if ${\textbf{A}_{x} = 3\ m}{}$ east,
${\textbf{A}_{y} = 4\ m}{}$ north, and ${\textbf{A} = 5\ m}{}$
north-east, then it is true that the vectors
${\mathbf{A}_{x}\text{~+~A}_{y}\text{~=~A}}{}$. However, it is **not**
true that the sum of the magnitudes of the vectors is also equal. That
is,

::: {#eip-818 data-type="equation"}
[ 3 m+4 m  ≠  5 m 3 m+4 m  ≠  5 m alignl { stack { size 12{\"3 M + 4
M \" \<\> \" 5 M\"} {} \# {} } } {} ]{.math
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"}
:::

Thus,

::: {#eip-505 data-type="equation"}
$${{A_{x} + A_{y}} \neq A}{}$$
:::

If the vector $\mathbf{A}{}$ is known, then its magnitude $A{}$ (its
length) and its angle $\theta{}$ (its direction) are known. To find
$A_{x}{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* and
*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*$A_{y}{}$, its **x**- and
*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*y**-components, we use the following
relationships for a right triangle.

::: {#eip-377 data-type="equation"}
$${{A_{x} = A}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}{}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-69 data-type="equation"}
$${{A_{y} = A}\ \text{sin}\ \theta}\text{.}{}$$
:::

![The magnitudes of the vector components $\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$ and
$\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$ can be related to the resultant vector $\mathbf{A}{}$
and the angle $\theta{}$ with trigonometric identities. Here we see that
${{A_{x} = A}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}{}$ and
${{A_{y} = A}\ \text{sin}\ \theta}{}$.](images/Figure_03_03_02a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298704788}

Suppose, for example, that $\mathbf{A}{}$ is the vector representing the
total displacement of the person walking in a city considered in
[Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction](/m54779) and [Vector
Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods](/m54781).

![We can use the relationships ${{A_{x} = A}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}{}$ and
${{A_{y} = A\ }\text{sin}\ \theta}{}$ to determine the magnitude of the
horizontal and vertical component vectors in this
example.](images/Figure_03_03_03.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298544262}

Then ${A = 10.3}{}$ blocks and $\theta = 29.1º$ , so that

::: {#eip-id1646569 data-type="equation"}
$$A_{x} = A\ \text{cos}\ \theta = \left( \text{10.3\ blocks} \right)\left( \text{cos}\ 29.1º \right) = \text{9.0\ blocks}$$

### Calculating a Resultant Vector {#calculating-a-resultant-vector data-type="title"}

If the perpendicular components $\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$ and
$\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$ of a vector $\mathbf{A}{}$ are known, then
$\mathbf{A}{}$ can also be found analytically. To find the magnitude
$A{}$ and direction $\theta{}$ of a vector from its perpendicular
components $\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$ and $\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$, we use the
following relationships:

::: {#eip-109 data-type="equation"}
$${A = \sqrt{A_{x^{2}} + A_{y^{2}}}}{}$$
:::

::: {#eip-750 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({A_{y}/A_{x}})}\text{.}{}$$
:::

![The magnitude and direction of the resultant vector can be determined
once the horizontal and vertical components $A_{x}{}$ and $A_{y}{}$ have
been
determined.](images/Figure_03_03_04a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298723894}

Note that the equation $A = \sqrt{A_{x}^{2} + A_{y}^{2}}$ is just the
Pythagorean theorem relating the legs of a right triangle to the length
of the hypotenuse. For example, if $A_{x}{}$ and $A_{y}{}$ are 9 and 5
blocks, respectively, then
${{A = \sqrt{9^{2}\text{+5}^{2}}}\text{=10}\text{.}3}{}$ blocks, again
consistent with the example of the person walking in a city. Finally,
the direction is ${\theta = \text{tan}^{–1}}(\text{5/9})=29.1º$ , as
before.

Determining Vectors and Vector Components with Analytical Methods
:::

Equations ${{A_{x} = A}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}{}$ and
${{A_{y} = A}\ \text{sin}\ \theta}{}$ are used to find the perpendicular
components of a vector---that is, to go from $A{}$ and $\theta{}$ to
$A_{x}{}$ and $A_{y}{}$. Equations
${A = \sqrt{A_{x}^{2} + A_{y}^{2}}}{}$ and
${{\theta = \text{tan}^{\text{–1}}}({A_{y}/A_{x}})}{}$ are used to find
a vector from its perpendicular components---that is, to go from
$A_{x}{}$ and $A_{y}{}$ to $A{}$ and $\theta$. Both processes are
crucial to analytical methods of vector addition and subtraction.

### Adding Vectors Using Analytical Methods {#adding-vectors-using-analytical-methods data-type="title"}

To see how to add vectors using perpendicular components, consider
[link](#import-auto-id1165298839640){.autogenerated-content}, in which
the vectors $\mathbf{A}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}{}$ are added to produce the
resultant $\mathbf{R}{}$.

![Vectors $\mathbf{A}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}{}$ are two legs of a walk, and
$\mathbf{R}{}$ is the resultant or total displacement. You can use
analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of
$\mathbf{R}{}$.](images/Figure_03_03_05a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298839640}

If $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ represent two legs of a walk (two
displacements), then $\mathbf{R}$ is the total displacement. The person
taking the walk ends up at the tip of $\mathbf{R}.$ There are many ways
to arrive at the same point. In particular, the person could have walked
first in the *x*-direction and then in the *y*-direction. Those paths
are the *x*- and *y*-components of the resultant, $\mathbf{R}_{x}$ and
$\mathbf{R}_{y}{}$. If we know $\textbf{R}_{x}{}$ and
$\mathbf{R}_{y}{}$, we can find $R$ and $\theta$ using the equations
$A = \sqrt{{A_{x}}^{2} + {A_{y}}^{2}}$ and
$\theta = \text{tan}^{–1}(A_{y}/A_{x})$. When you use the analytical
method of vector addition, you can determine the components or the
magnitude and direction of a vector.

***Step 1.** *Identify the x- and y-axes that will be used in the
problem. Then, find the components of each vector to be added along the
chosen perpendicular axes*.* Use the equations
${{A_{x} = A}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}{}$ and
${{A_{y} = A}\ \text{sin}\ \theta}{}$ to find the components. In
[link](#import-auto-id1165296674934){.autogenerated-content}, these
components are $A_{x}{}$, $A_{y}{}$, $B_{x}{}$, and $B_{y}{}$. The
angles that vectors $\mathbf{A}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}{}$ make with the
**x**-axis are $\theta_{\text{A}}{}$ and $\theta_{\text{B}}{}$,
respectively.

![To add vectors $\mathbf{A}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}{}$, first determine the
horizontal and vertical components of each vector. These are the dotted
vectors $\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$, $\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$, $\mathbf{B}_{x}{}$ and
$\textbf{B}_{y}$ shown in the
image.](images/Figure_03_03_06a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296674934}

***Step 2.** *Find the components of the resultant along each axis by
adding the components of the individual vectors along that axis*.* That
is, as shown in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298866862){.autogenerated-content},

::: {#eip-284 data-type="equation"}
$${R_{x} = {A_{x} + B_{x}}}{}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-92 data-type="equation"}
$${R_{y} = {A_{y} + B_{y}}}\text{.}{}$$
:::

![The magnitude of the vectors $\mathbf{A}_{x}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}_{x}{}$
add to give the magnitude $R_{x}{}$ of the resultant vector in the
horizontal direction. Similarly, the magnitudes of the vectors
$\mathbf{A}_{y}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}_{y}{}$ add to give the magnitude
$R_{y}{}$ of the resultant vector in the vertical
direction.](images/Figure_03_03_07a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298866862}

Components along the same axis, say the **x**-axis, are vectors along
the same line and, thus, can be added to one another like ordinary
numbers. The same is true for components along the **y**-axis. (For
example, a 9-block eastward walk could be taken in two legs, the first 3
blocks east and the second 6 blocks east, for a total of 9, because they
are along the same direction.) So resolving vectors into components
along common axes makes it easier to add them. Now that the components
of $\mathbf{R}{}$ are known, its magnitude and direction can be found.

***Step 3.** *To get the magnitude $R$ of the resultant, use the
Pythagorean theorem:**

::: {#eip-960 data-type="equation"}
$${R = \sqrt{R_{x}^{2} + R_{y}^{2}}}\text{.}{}$$
:::

***Step 4.** *To get the direction of the resultant:**

::: {#eip-173 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({R_{y}/R_{x}})}\text{.}{}$$
:::

The following example illustrates this technique for adding vectors
using perpendicular components.

::: {#fs-id1608746 data-type="example"}
::: {data-type="title"}
Adding Vectors Using Analytical Methods
:::

Add the vector $\mathbf{A}{}$ to the vector $\mathbf{B}{}$ shown in
[link](#import-auto-id1165296662297){.autogenerated-content}, using
perpendicular components along the **x**- and **y**-axes. The **x**- and
**y**-axes are along the east--west and north--south directions,
respectively. Vector $\mathbf{A}{}$ represents the first leg of a walk
in which a person walks ${\text{53}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}{}$ in a
direction ${\text{20}\text{.}0\text{º}}{}$ north of east. Vector
$\mathbf{B}{}$ represents the second leg, a displacement of
${\text{34}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}{}$ in a direction
${\text{63}\text{.}0\text{º}}{}$ north of east.

![Vector $\mathbf{A}{}$ has magnitude ${\text{53}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}{}$
and direction ${\text{20}\text{.}0º}{}$ north of the *x*-axis. Vector
$\mathbf{B}{}$ has magnitude ${\text{34}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}{}$ and
direction ${\text{63}\text{.}0\text{º}}{}$ north of the *x*-axis. You
can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of
$\mathbf{R}{}$.](images/Figure_03_03_08a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296662297}

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

The components of $\mathbf{A}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}{}$ along the **x**- and
**y**-axes represent walking due east and due north to get to the same
ending point. Once found, they are combined to produce the resultant.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

Following the method outlined above, we first find the components of
$\mathbf{A}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}{}$ along the **x**- and **y**-axes. Note
that $A = 53.0\ m$, $\theta_{\text{A}} = 20.0º$, $B = 34.0\ m$, and
${\theta_{\text{B}} = 63.0º}{}$. We find the **x**-components by using
${{A_{x} = A}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}{}$, which gives

::: {#eip-253 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
A_{x} & = & {A\ \text{cos}\ {\theta_{A} = (}\text{53.}0\ m)(\text{cos\ 20.0º})} \\
 & = & {(\text{53.}0\ m)(0\text{.940}) = \text{49.}8\ m} \\
\end{array}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-356 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
B_{x} & = & {B\ \text{cos}\ {\theta_{B} = (}\text{34}\text{.}0\ m)(\text{cos\ 63.0º})} \\
 & = & {{(}\text{34}\text{.}0\ m)(0\text{.}\text{454}{) = \text{15}}\text{.}4\ m\text{.}} \\
\end{array}{}$$
:::

Similarly, the *y*-components are found using
${{A_{y} = A}\ \text{sin}\ \theta_{A}}{}$:

::: {#eip-802 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
A_{y} & = & {A\ \text{sin}{\ \theta_{A} = (}\text{53}\text{.}0\ m)(\text{sin\ 20.0º})} \\
 & = & {{(}\text{53}\text{.}0\ m)(0\text{.}\text{342}{) = \text{18}}\text{.}1\ m} \\
\end{array}{}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-837 data-type="equation"}
$$\begin{array}{lll}
B_{y} & = & {B\ \text{sin}\ {\theta_{B} = (}\text{34}\text{.}0\ m)(\text{sin\ 63}\text{.}0º)} \\
 & = & {{(}\text{34}\text{.}0\ m)(0\text{.}\text{891}{) = \text{30}}\text{.}3\ m\text{.}} \\
\end{array}{}$$
:::

The **x**- and **y**-components of the resultant are thus

::: {#eip-196 data-type="equation"}
$${{{R_{x} = {A_{x} + B_{x}}} = \text{49}}\text{.}8\ m{+ \text{15}}\text{.}4\ m{= \text{65}}\text{.}2\ m}{}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-325 data-type="equation"}
$${{{R_{y} = {A_{y} + B_{y}}} = \text{18}}\text{.}1\ m{+ \text{30}}\text{.}3\ m{= \text{48}}\text{.}4\ m\text{.}}{}$$
:::

Now we can find the magnitude of the resultant by using the Pythagorean
theorem:

::: {#eip-941 data-type="equation"}
$${{R = \sqrt{R_{x}^{2} + R_{y}^{2}}} = \sqrt{{(\text{65}\text{.}2{)^{2} + (}\text{48}\text{.}4)^{2}}\ \text{m}}}{}$$
:::

so that

::: {#eip-702 data-type="equation"}
$$R = 81.2\ m.$$
:::

Finally, we find the direction of the resultant:

::: {#eip-713 data-type="equation"}
$${{{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}({R_{y}/R_{x}})\text{=+}\text{tan}^{- 1}(\text{48}\text{.}{4/\text{65}}\text{.}2)}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

Thus,

::: {#eip-755 data-type="equation"}
$${{\theta = \text{tan}^{- 1}}(0\text{.}\text{742}{) = \text{36}}\text{.}6º\text{.}}{}$$
:::

![Using analytical methods, we see that the magnitude of $\mathbf{R}{}$
is ${\text{81}\text{.}\text{2\ m}}{}$ and its direction is
${\text{36}\text{.}6º}{}$ north of
east.](images/Figure_03_03_09a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298804108}

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

This example illustrates the addition of vectors using perpendicular
components. Vector subtraction using perpendicular components is very
similar---it is just the addition of a negative vector.

Subtraction of vectors is accomplished by the addition of a negative
vector. That is,
${{{\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}} \equiv {{\mathbf{A} + (}\mathbf{–B}}})}{}$.
Thus, *the method for the subtraction of vectors using perpendicular
components is identical to that for addition*. The components of
$\textbf{–B}{}$ are the negatives of the components of $\mathbf{B}{}$.
The *x*- and **y**-components of the resultant
${\mathbf{A} - \text{B\ =\ R}}{}$ are thus

::: {#eip-772 data-type="equation"}
$${R_{x} = {A_{x} + \left( –B_{x} \right)}}{}$$
:::

and

::: {#eip-532 data-type="equation"}
$${R_{y} = {A_{y} + \left( –B_{y} \right)}}{}$$
:::

and the rest of the method outlined above is identical to that for
addition. (See
[link](#import-auto-id1165298841604){.autogenerated-content}.)
:::

Analyzing vectors using perpendicular components is very useful in many
areas of physics, because perpendicular quantities are often independent
of one another. The next module, [Projectile Motion](/m54787), is one of
many in which using perpendicular components helps make the picture
clear and simplifies the physics.

Solve the following problem using analytical techniques: Suppose you
walk 18.0 m straight west and then 25.0 m straight north. How far are
you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a
line connecting your starting point to your final position? (If you
represent the two legs of the walk as vector displacements
$\mathbf{A}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}{}$, as in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298935750){.autogenerated-content}, then this
problem asks you to find their sum
${\mathbf{R} = {\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}}}{}$.)

![The two displacements $\mathbf{A}{}$ and $\mathbf{B}{}$ add to give a
total displacement $\mathbf{R}{}$ having magnitude $R{}$ and direction
$\theta{}$.](images/Figure_03_02_21a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298935750}

Note that you can also solve this graphically. Discuss why the
analytical technique for solving this problem is potentially more
accurate than the graphical technique.

Repeat [link](#eip-287){.autogenerated-content} using analytical
techniques, but reverse the order of the two legs of the walk and show
that you get the same final result. (This problem shows that adding them
in reverse order gives the same result---that is,
$\textbf{B\ +\ A\ =\ A\ +\ B}$.) Discuss how taking another path to
reach the same point might help to overcome an obstacle blocking you
other path.

You drive ${7\text{.}\text{50\ km}}{}$ in a straight line in a direction
$15º$ east of north. (a) Find the distances you would have to drive
straight east and then straight north to arrive at the same point. (This
determination is equivalent to find the components of the displacement
along the east and north directions.) (b) Show that you still arrive at
the same point if the east and north legs are reversed in order.

Do [link](#eip-287){.autogenerated-content} again using analytical
techniques and change the second leg of the walk to $\text{25.0\ m}{}$
straight south. (This is equivalent to subtracting $\mathbf{B}{}$ from
$\mathbf{A}{}$ ---that is, finding
${\textbf{R}\prime = \textbf{A\ –\ B}}{}$) (b) Repeat again, but now you
first walk ${\text{25}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}{}$ north and then
${\text{18}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}{}$ east. (This is equivalent to subtract
$\mathbf{A}{}$ from $\mathbf{B}{}$ ---that is, to find
${\mathbf{A} = {\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{C}}}{}$. Is that consistent with
your result?)

A new landowner has a triangular piece of flat land she wishes to fence.
Starting at the west corner, she measures the first side to be 80.0 m
long and the next to be 105 m. These sides are represented as
displacement vectors $\mathbf{A}{}$ from $\mathbf{B}{}$ in
[link](#eip-id3165265){.autogenerated-content}. She then correctly
calculates the length and orientation of the third side $\text{C}{}$.
What is her result?

In an attempt to escape his island, Gilligan builds a raft and sets to
sea. The wind shifts a great deal during the day, and he is blown along
the following straight lines: ${2\text{.}\text{50\ km}}{}$ $45.0º{}$
north of west; then ${4\text{.}\text{70\ km}}{}$ $60.0º{}$ south of
east; then ${1.30\ \text{km}}{}$ $25.0º{}$ south of west; then
${5\text{.}\text{10\ km}}{}$ straight east; then ${1.70\ \text{km}}{}$
$5.00º$ east of north; then ${7\text{.}\text{20\ km}}{}$ $55.0º$ south
of west; and finally ${2\text{.}\text{80\ km}}{}$ $10.0º$ north of east.
What is his final position relative to the island?

[Friction]{#import-auto-id1165298484489 data-type="term"} is a force
that is around us all the time that opposes relative motion between
systems in contact but also allows us to move (which you have discovered
if you have ever tried to walk on ice). While a common force, the
behavior of friction is actually very complicated and is still not
completely understood. We have to rely heavily on observations for
whatever understandings we can gain. However, we can still deal with its
more elementary general characteristics and understand the circumstances
in which it behaves.

Friction
:::

Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in
contact.
:::

One of the simpler characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to
the contact surface between systems and always in a direction that
opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each
other. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another,
then the friction between them is called [kinetic
friction]{#import-auto-id1165296294917 data-type="term"}. For example,
friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice. But when objects are
stationary, [static friction]{#import-auto-id1165298806829
data-type="term"}**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}** can act between
them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction
between the objects.

Kinetic Friction
:::

If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then
the friction between them is called kinetic friction.
:::

Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete
floor---you may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at
all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do---it
increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. But
if you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and
starts to move. Once in motion it is easier to keep it in motion than it
was to get it started, indicating that the kinetic friction force is
less than the static friction force. If you add mass to the crate, say
by placing a box on top of it, you need to push even harder to get it
started and also to keep it moving. Furthermore, if you oiled the
concrete you would find it to be easier to get the crate started and
keep it going (as you might expect).

[link](#import-auto-id1165298476574){.autogenerated-content}
**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}**is a crude pictorial representation of
how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Close-up
inspection of these surfaces shows them to be rough. So when you push to
get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object
until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break
off the points, or do both. A considerable force can be resisted by
friction with no apparent motion. The harder the surfaces are pushed
together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force
is needed to move them. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces
between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explain the
dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. Adhesion varies
with substances in contact and is a complicated aspect of surface
physics. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact
(fewer molecules adhering), so less force is required to keep the object
moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of
speed.

![Frictional forces, such as $f{}$, always oppose motion or attempted
motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because of
the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view.
In order for the object to move, it must rise to where the peaks can
skip along the bottom surface. Thus a force is required just to set the
object in motion. Some of the peaks will be broken off, also requiring a
force to maintain motion. Much of the friction is actually due to
attractive forces between molecules making up the two objects, so that
even perfectly smooth surfaces are not friction-free. Such adhesive
forces also depend on the substances the surfaces are made of,
explaining, for example, why rubber-soled shoes slip less than those
with leather
soles.](images/Figure_06_01_01a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298476574}

The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static
situations (static friction), the other for when there is motion
(kinetic friction).

When there is no motion between the objects, the [magnitude of static
friction $\mathbf{f}_{\text{s}}{}$]{#import-auto-id1165298867639
data-type="term"} is

::: {#eip-70 data-type="equation"}
$${{{f_{s} \leq \mu_{s}}N},}{}$$
:::

where $\mu_{\text{s}}{}$ is the coefficient of static friction and $N$
is the magnitude of the normal force
**`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}**(the force perpendicular to the
surface).

is the magnitude of the normal force.
:::

The symbol $\leq {}$ means *less than or equal to*, implying that static
friction can have a minimum and a maximum value of
${\mu_{\text{s}}N}{}$. Static friction is a responsive force that
increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is exerted, up to
its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds
$f_{\text{s}(\text{max})}{}$, the object will move. Thus

::: {#eip-410 data-type="equation"}
$${{{f_{\text{s}(\text{max})} = \mu_{\text{s}}}N}.}{}$$

As seen in [link](#import-auto-id1165298658126){.autogenerated-content},
the coefficients of kinetic friction are less than their static

  : [Coefficients of Static and Kinetic Friction]{data-type="title"}

The equations given earlier **`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}**include
the dependence of friction on materials and the normal force. The
direction of friction is always opposite that of motion, parallel to the
surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal force. For
example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the
floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its
weight,
${{{W = {mg}} = (}\text{100\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80}\ \text{m/s}^{2}) = \text{980\ N}}{}$,
perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is
0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than
${{f_{\text{s}(\text{max})} = \mu_{\text{s}}}{N =}\left( 0.45 \right){(\text{980}}{\ \text{N}) = \text{440}}\ \text{N}}\ {}$to
move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the
coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only
290 N
(${{f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}}}{N = \left( {0\text{.}\text{30}} \right)}{\left( {\text{980}\ \text{N}} \right) = \text{290}}\ \text{N}}{}$)
would keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor is lubricated,
both coefficients are considerably less than they would be without
lubrication. Coefficient of friction is a unit less quantity with a
magnitude usually between 0 and 1.0. The coefficient of the friction
depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.

Take-Home Experiment

Find a small plastic object (such as a food container) and slide it on a
kitchen table by giving it a gentle tap. Now spray water on the table,
simulating a light shower of rain. What happens now when you give the
object the same-sized tap? Now add a few drops of (vegetable or olive)
oil on the surface of the water and give the same tap. What happens now?
This latter situation is particularly important for drivers to note,
especially after a light rain shower. Why?
:::

Many people have experienced the slipperiness of walking on ice.
However, many parts of the body, especially the joints, have much
smaller coefficients of friction---often three or four times less than
ice. A joint is formed by the ends of two bones, which are connected by
thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by the lower leg bone (the
tibia) and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a ball (at the end of
the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The ends of the bones
in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth, almost
glassy surface. The joints also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that
reduces friction and wear. A damaged or arthritic joint can be replaced
by an artificial joint
([link](#import-auto-id1165296217318){.autogenerated-content}). These
replacements can be made of metals (stainless steel or titanium) or
plastic (polyethylene), also with very small coefficients of friction.

![Artificial knee replacement is a procedure that has been performed for
more than 20 years. In this figure, we see the post-op x rays of the
right knee joint replacement. (credit: Mike Baird,

Other natural lubricants include saliva produced in our mouths to aid in
the swallowing process, and the slippery mucus found between organs in
the body, allowing them to move freely past each other during
heartbeats, during breathing, and when a person moves. Artificial
lubricants are also common in hospitals and doctor\'s clinics. For
example, when ultrasonic imaging is carried out, the gel that couples
the transducer to the skin also serves to lubricate the surface between
the transducer and the skin---thereby reducing the coefficient of
friction between the two surfaces. This allows the transducer to mover
freely over the skin.

Skiing Exercise
:::

A skier with a mass of 62 kg is sliding down a snowy slope. Find the
coefficient of kinetic friction for the skier if friction is known to be
45.0 N.

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

The magnitude of kinetic friction was given in to be 45.0 N. Kinetic
friction is related to the normal force $N{}$ as
${{f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}}}N}{}$; thus, the coefficient of kinetic
friction can be found if we can find the normal force of the skier on a
slope. The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface, and
since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal force
should equal the component of the skier\'s weight perpendicular to the
slope. (See the skier and free-body diagram in
[link](#import-auto-id1165296217411){.autogenerated-content}.)

![The motion of the skier and friction are parallel to the slope and so
it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system
where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular
(axes shown to left of skier). $\textbf{N}$ (the normal force) is
perpendicular to the slope, and $\textbf{f}$ (the friction) is parallel
to the slope, but $\textbf{w}$ (the skier\'s weight) has components
along both axes, namely $\textbf{w}_{\text{⊥}}{}$ and
$\textbf{W}_{//}{}$. $N{}$ is equal in magnitude to [w⊥w⊥]{.math
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"}, so there
is no motion perpendicular to the slope. However, $f{}$ is less than
$W_{\text{//}}{}$ in magnitude, so there is acceleration down the slope
(along the
*x*-axis).](images/Figure_06_01_03a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165296217411}

That is,

$${{f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}}}\text{mg}\ \text{cos}\,\text{25º}}{},$$

$${{{\mu_{\text{k}} = \frac{\text{45.0\ N}}{(\text{62\ kg})(9\text{.}\text{80\ m}\text{/s}^{2})(0\text{.}\text{906})}} = 0}\text{.}\text{082}.}{}$$

[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

This result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed in
[link](#import-auto-id1165298658126){.autogenerated-content} for waxed
wood on snow, but it is still reasonable since values of the
coefficients of friction can vary greatly. In situations like this,
where an object of mass $m$ slides down a slope that makes an angle
$\theta$ with the horizontal, friction is given by
${{f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}}}\text{mg}\,\text{cos}\,\theta}{}$. All
objects will slide down a slope with constant acceleration under these
circumstances. Proof of this is left for this chapter\'s Problems and
Exercises.

Take-Home Experiment
:::

An object will slide down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if
the net force on the object is zero. We can use this fact to measure the
coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects. As shown in
[link](#fs-id1704828){.autogenerated-content}, the kinetic friction on a
slope
${{f_{\text{k}} = \mu_{\text{k}}}\text{mg}\ \text{cos}\,\theta}{}$. The
component of the weight down the slope is equal to
${\text{mg}\ \text{sin}\,\theta}{}$ (see the free-body diagram in
[link](#import-auto-id1165296217411){.autogenerated-content}). These
forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude,
the acceleration is zero. Writing these out:

:::

::: {#eip-368 data-type="equation"}
$${{\mu_{\text{k}}\text{mg}\ \text{cos}\ {\theta = \text{mg}}\ \text{sin}\ \theta}.}{}$$
:::

Solving for $\mu_{\text{k}}{}$, we find that

::: {#eip-680 data-type="equation"}
$${{{{\mu_{\text{k}} = \frac{\text{mg}\ \text{sin}\ \theta}{\text{mg}\ \text{cos}\ \theta}} = \text{tan}}\ \theta}.}{}$$
:::

Put a coin on a book and tilt it until the coin slides at a constant
velocity down the book. You might need to tap the book lightly to get
the coin to move. Measure the angle of tilt relative to the horizontal
and find $\mu_{\text{k}}{}$. Note that the coin will not start to slide
at all until an angle greater than $\theta$ is attained, since the
coefficient of static friction is larger than the coefficient of kinetic
friction. Discuss how this may affect the value for $\mu_{\text{k}}{}$
and its uncertainty.
:::

We have discussed that when an object rests on a horizontal surface,
there is a normal force supporting it equal in magnitude to its weight.
Furthermore, simple friction is always proportional to the normal force.

Making Connections: Submicroscopic Explanations of Friction
:::

The simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic
(large-scale) characteristics. Great strides have been made in the
atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades.
Researchers are finding that the atomic nature of friction seems to have
several fundamental characteristics. These characteristics not only
explain some of the simpler aspects of friction---they also hold the
potential for the development of nearly friction-free environments that
could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which is currently
being converted (unnecessarily) to heat.
:::

[link](#import-auto-id1165298530900){.autogenerated-content} illustrates
one macroscopic characteristic of friction that is explained by
microscopic (small-scale) research. We have noted that friction is
proportional to the normal force, but not to the area in contact, a
somewhat counterintuitive notion. When two rough surfaces are in
contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction of the total area
since only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the
actual contact area increases, and it is found that the friction is
proportional to this area.

![Two rough surfaces in contact have a much smaller area of actual
contact than their total area. When there is a greater normal force as a
result of a greater applied force, the area of actual contact increases
as does
friction.](images/Figure_06_01_04a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298530900}

But the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler
features of friction. The mechanism for how heat is generated is now
being determined. In other words, why do surfaces get warmer when
rubbed? Essentially, atoms are linked with one another to form lattices.
When surfaces rub, the surface atoms adhere and cause atomic lattices to
vibrate---essentially creating sound waves that penetrate the material.
The sound waves diminish with distance and their energy is converted
into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional wear can
also occur between atoms and molecules on the surfaces.
[link](#import-auto-id1165298744656){.autogenerated-content} shows how
the tip of a probe drawn across another material is deformed by
atomic-scale friction. The force needed to drag the tip can be measured
and is found to be related to shear stress, which will be discussed
later in this chapter. The variation in shear stress is remarkable (more
than a factor of $\text{10}^{\text{12}}{}$ ) and difficult to predict
theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a fundamental understanding
of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient times---friction.

![The tip of a probe is deformed sideways by frictional force as the
probe is dragged across a surface. Measurements of how the force varies
for different materials are yielding fundamental insights into the
atomic nature of
friction.](images/Figure_06_01_05a.jpg){#import-auto-id1165298744656}

### Section Summary { data-type="title"}

-   [Friction is a contact force between systems that opposes the motion
    or attempted motion between them. Simple friction is proportional to
    the normal force $N{}$ pushing the systems together. (A normal force

When you push a piece of chalk across a chalkboard, it sometimes
screeches because it rapidly alternates between slipping and sticking to
the board. Describe this process in more detail, in particular
explaining how it is related to the fact that kinetic friction is less
than static friction. (The same slip-grab process occurs when tires
screech on pavement.)

Have you ever wondered why it is difficult to walk on a smooth surface
like ice? The interaction between you and the surface is a result of
forces that affect your motion. In the previous chapter, you learned
Newton\'s laws of motion and examined how net force affects the motion,
position and shape of an object. Now we will look at some interesting
and common forces that will provide further applications of Newton\'s
laws of motion.

The information presented in this chapter supports learning objectives
covered under Big Idea 3 of the AP Physics Curriculum Framework, which
refer to the nature of forces and their roles in interactions among
objects. The chapter discusses examples of specific contact forces, such
as friction, air or liquid drag, and elasticity that may affect the
motion or shape of an object. It also discusses the nature of forces on
both macroscopic and microscopic levels (Enduring Understanding 3.C and
Essential Knowledge 3.C.4). In addition, Newton\'s laws are applied to
describe the motion of an object (Enduring Understanding 3.B) and to
examine relationships between contact forces and other forces exerted on
an object (Enduring Understanding 3.A, 3.A.3 and Essential Knowledge
3.A.4). The examples in this chapter give you practice in using vector
properties of forces (Essential Knowledge 3.A.2) and free-body diagrams
(Essential Knowledge 3.B.2) to determine net force (Essential Knowledge
3.B.1).

**Big Idea 3** The interactions of an object with other objects can be
described by forces.

Enduring Understanding 3.A All forces share certain common
characteristics when considered by observers in inertial reference
frames.

Essential Knowledge 3.A.2 Forces are described by vectors.

Essential Knowledge 3.A.3 A force exerted on an object is always due to
the interaction of that object with another object.

Essential Knowledge 3.A.4 If one object exerts a force on a second
object, the second object always exerts a force of equal magnitude on
the ﬁrst object in the opposite direction.

Enduring Understanding 3.B Classically, the acceleration of an object
interacting with other objects can be predicted by using
$\overset{\rightarrow}{a} = \frac{\sum\overset{\rightarrow}{F}}{m}$ .

Essential Knowledge 3.B.1 If an object of interest interacts with
several other objects, the net force is the vector sum of the individual
forces.

Essential Knowledge 3.B.2 Free-body diagrams are useful tools for
visualizing forces being exerted on a single object and writing the
equations that represent a physical situation.

Enduring Understanding 3.C At the macroscopic level, forces can be
categorized as either long-range (action-at-a-distance) forces or
contact forces.

Essential Knowledge 3.C.4 Contact forces result from the interaction of
one object touching another object, and they arise from interatomic
electric forces. These forces include tension, friction, normal, spring
(Physics 1), and buoyant (Physics 2).

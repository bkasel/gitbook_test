Wo man auch hinsieht, beobachtet man KÃ¶rper in Bewegung.
Objects are in motion everywhere we look. Everything from a tennis game
to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you
are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in
inanimate objects, there is a continuous motion in the vibrations of
atoms and molecules. Questions about motion are interesting in and of
themselves: *How long will it take for a space probe to get to Mars?
Where will a football land if it is thrown at a certain angle?*

Understanding motion will not only provide answers to these questions,
but will be key to understanding more advanced concepts in physics. For
example, the discussion of force in Chapter 4 will not fully make sense
until you understand acceleration. This relationship between force and
acceleration is also critical to understanding Big Idea 3.

Additionally, this unit will explore the topic of reference frames, a
critical component to quantifying how things move. If you have ever
waved to a departing friend at a train station, you are likely familiar
with this idea. While you see your friend move away from you at a
considerable rate, those sitting with her will likely see her as not
moving. The effect that the chosen reference frame has on your
observations is substantial, and an understanding of this is needed to
grasp both Enduring Understanding 3.A and Essential Knowledge 3.A.1.

Our formal study of physics begins with **kinematics,** which is defined
as the *study of motion without considering its causes*. In one- and
two-dimensional kinematics we will study only the *motion* of a
football, for example, without worrying about what forces cause or
change its motion. In this chapter, we examine the simplest type of
motion---namely, motion along a straight line, or one-dimensional
motion. Later, in two-dimensional kinematics, we apply concepts
developed here to study motion along curved paths (two- and
three-dimensional motion), for example, that of a car rounding a curve.

The content in this chapter supports:

**Big Idea 3** The interactions of an object with other objects can be
described by forces.

Enduring Understanding 3.A All forces share certain common
characteristics when considered by observers in inertial reference
frames.

Essential Knowledge 3.A.1 An observer in a particular reference frame
can describe the motion of an object using such quantities as position,
displacement, distance, velocity, speed, and acceleration.

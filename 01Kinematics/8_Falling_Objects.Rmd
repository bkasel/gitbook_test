Falling objects form an interesting class of motion problems. For
example, we can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping
a rock into it and listening for the rock to hit the bottom. By applying
the kinematics developed so far to falling objects, we can examine some
interesting situations and learn much about gravity in the process.

### Gravity {#gravity data-type="title"}

The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that,
if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location
all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the *same constant
acceleration*, *independent of their mass*. This experimentally
determined fact is unexpected, because we are so accustomed to the
effects of air resistance and friction that we expect light objects to
fall slower than heavy ones.

![A hammer and a feather will fall with the same constant acceleration
if air resistance is considered negligible. This is a general
characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R.
Scott demonstrated on the Moon in 1971, where the acceleration due to
gravity is only
${1\text{.}\text{67\ m/s}^{2}}{}$.](images/Figure_02_07_00a.jpg){#import-auto-id4126662}

In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall
slower than a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball will reach
the ground after a hard baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be
difficult to observe the difference if the height is not large.) Air
resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, while
friction between objects---such as between clothes and a laundry chute
or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped---also opposes
motion between them. For the ideal situations of these first few
chapters, an object *falling without air resistance or friction* is
defined to be in [free-fall]{#import-auto-id1714641 data-type="term"}.

The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth.
The acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore called the
[acceleration due to gravity]{#import-auto-id1707599 data-type="term"}.
The acceleration due to gravity is *constant*, which means we can apply
the kinematics equations to any falling object where air resistance and
friction are negligible. This opens a broad class of interesting
situations to us. The acceleration due to gravity is so important that
its magnitude is given its own symbol, $g{}$. It is constant at any
given location on Earth and has the average value

::: {#eip-636 data-type="equation"}
$${{g = 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}\text{.}{}$$
:::

Although $g{}$ varies from ${9\text{.}\text{78\ m/s}^{2}}{}$ to
${9\text{.}\text{83\ m/s}^{2}}{}$, depending on latitude, altitude,
underlying geological formations, and local topography, the average
value of ${9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$ will be used in this text
unless otherwise specified. The direction of the acceleration due to
gravity is *downward (towards the center of Earth)*. In fact, its
direction *defines* what we call vertical. Note that whether the
acceleration $a{}$ in the kinematic equations has the value ${+ g}{}$ or
${- g}{}$ depends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define
the upward direction as positive, then
${{{a = {- g}} = {- 9}}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$, and if we define
the downward direction as positive, then
${{{a = g} = 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$.

### One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity {#one-dimensional-motion-involving-gravity data-type="title"}

The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to
start with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex
ones. So we start by considering straight up and down motion with no air
resistance or friction. These assumptions mean that the velocity (if
there is any) is vertical. If the object is dropped, we know the initial
velocity is zero. Once the object has left contact with whatever held or
threw it, the object is in free-fall. Under these circumstances, the
motion is one-dimensional and has constant acceleration of magnitude
$g{}$. We will also represent vertical displacement with the symbol
$y{}$ and use $x{}$ for horizontal displacement.

Calculating Position and Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown
Upward
:::

A person standing on the edge of a high cliff throws a rock straight up
with an initial velocity of 13.0 m/s. The rock misses the edge of the
cliff as it falls back to Earth. Calculate the position and velocity of
the rock 1.00 s, 2.00 s, and 3.00 s after it is thrown, neglecting the
effects of air resistance.

We are asked to determine the position $y{}$ at various times. It is
reasonable to take the initial position $y_{0}{}$ to be zero. This
problem involves one-dimensional motion in the vertical direction. We
use plus and minus signs to indicate direction, with up being positive
and down negative. Since up is positive, and the rock is thrown upward,
the initial velocity must be positive too. The acceleration due to
gravity is downward, so $a{}$ is negative. It is crucial that the
initial velocity and the acceleration due to gravity have opposite
signs. Opposite signs indicate that the acceleration due to gravity
opposes the initial motion and will slow and eventually reverse it.

Since we are asked for values of position and velocity at three times,
we will refer to these as $y_{1}{}$ and $v_{1}{}$; *$y_{2}{}$* and
$v_{2}{}$; and $y_{3}{}$ and $v_{3}{}$.

**Solution for Position** $y_{1}{}$

1\. Identify the knowns. We know that ${y_{0} = 0}{}$;
${{v_{0} = \text{13}}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}}{}$;
${{{a = {- g}} = {- 9}}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$; and
${{t = 1}\text{.}\text{00\ s}}{}$.

2\. Identify the best equation to use. We will use
${{y = {y_{0} + v_{0}}}{t + \frac{1}{2}}\text{at}^{2}}{}$ because it
includes only one unknown, $y{}$ (or $y_{1}{}$,
here),*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* which is the value we want to
find.

3\. Plug in the known values and solve for $y_{1}{}$.

The rock is 8.10 m above its starting point at
${{t = 1}\text{.}\text{00}}{}$ s, since ${y_{1} > y_{0}}{}$. It could be
*moving* up or down; the only way to tell is to calculate $v_{1}{}$ and
find out if it is positive or negative.

**Solution for Velocity** $v_{1}{}$

1\. Identify the knowns. We know that ${y_{0} = 0}{}$;
${{v_{0} = \text{13}}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}}{}$;
${{{a = {- g}} = {- 9}}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$; and
${{t = 1}\text{.}\text{00\ s}}{}$. We also know from the solution above
that ${{y_{1} = 8}\text{.}\text{10\ m}}{}$.

2\. Identify the best equation to use. The most straightforward is
${v = {v_{0} - \text{gt}}}{}$ (from ${v = {v_{0} + \text{at}}}{}$, where
${{a = \text{gravitational\ acceleration}} = {- g}}{}$).

3\. Plug in the knowns and solve.

The positive value for $v_{1}{}$ means that the rock is still heading
upward at ${{t = 1}\text{.}\text{00}\ \text{s}}{}$. However, it has

Graphing the data helps us understand it more clearly.

time for a rock thrown vertically up at the edge of a cliff. Notice that
velocity changes linearly with time and that acceleration is constant.
*Misconception Alert!* Notice that the position vs. time graph shows
vertical position only. It is easy to get the impression that the graph
shows some horizontal motion---the shape of the graph looks like the
path of a projectile. But this is not the case; the horizontal axis is
*time*, not space. The actual path of the rock in space is straight up,
and straight down.](images/Figure_02_06_01.jpg){#import-auto-id4064055}

The interpretation of these results is important. At 1.00 s the rock is
above its starting point and heading upward, since $y_{1}{}$ and
$v_{1}{}$ are both positive. At 2.00 s, the rock is still above its
starting point, but the negative velocity means it is moving downward.
At 3.00 s, both $y_{3}{}$ and $v_{3}{}$ are negative, meaning the rock
is below its starting point and continuing to move downward. Notice that
when the rock is at its highest point (at 1.5 s), its velocity is zero,
but its acceleration is still ${{- 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$. Its
acceleration is
${{- 9}\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$^`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}^
for the whole trip---while it is moving up and while it is moving down.
Note that the values for $y{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* are the
positions (or displacements) of the rock, not the total distances
traveled. Finally, note that free-fall applies to upward motion as well
as downward. Both have the same acceleration---the acceleration due to
gravity, which remains constant the entire time. Astronauts training in
the famous Vomit Comet, for example, experience free-fall while arcing
up as well as down, as we will discuss in more detail later.

Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment---Reaction Time
:::

A simple experiment can be done to determine your reaction time. Have a
friend hold a ruler between your thumb and index finger, separated by
about 1 cm. Note the mark on the ruler that is right between your
fingers. Have your friend drop the ruler unexpectedly, and try to catch
it between your two fingers. Note the new reading on the ruler. Assuming
acceleration is that due to gravity, calculate your reaction time. How
far would you travel in a car (moving at 30 m/s) if the time it took
your foot to go from the gas pedal to the brake was twice this reaction
time?

Calculating Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Down
:::

What happens if the person on the cliff throws the rock straight down,
instead of straight up? To explore this question, calculate the velocity
of the rock when it is 5.10 m below the starting point, and has been
thrown downward with an initial speed of 13.0 m/s.

![](images/Figure_02_06_01a.jpg){#import-auto-id2150750}

Since up is positive, the final position of the rock will be negative
because it finishes below the starting point at ${y_{0} = 0}{}$.
Similarly, the initial velocity is downward and therefore negative, as
is the acceleration due to gravity. We expect the final velocity to be
negative since the rock will continue to move downward.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

1\. Identify the knowns. $y_{0} = 0$;
${y_{1}{= - 5}}\text{.}\text{10\ m}$;
$v_{0} = {- \text{13}}\text{.0\ m/s}$;
${{{a = {- g}} = {- 9}}\text{.}\text{80\ m}\text{/s}^{2}}{}$.

2\. Choose the kinematic equation that makes it easiest to solve the
problem. The equation ${{v^{2} = {v_{0}^{2} + 2a}}({y - y_{0}})}{}$
works well because the only unknown in it is $v{}$. (We will plug
$y_{1}{}$ in for $y{}$.)

3\. Enter the known values

where we have retained extra significant figures because this is an

Note that *this is exactly the same velocity the rock had at this
position when it was thrown straight upward with the same initial
speed*. (See [link](#fs-id4067058){.autogenerated-content} and
[link](#import-auto-id4173440){.autogenerated-content}(a).) This is not
a coincidental result. Because we only consider the acceleration due to
gravity in this problem, the *speed* of a falling object depends only on
its initial speed and its vertical position relative to the starting
point. For example, if the velocity of the rock is calculated at a
height of 8.10 m above the starting point (using the method from
[link](#fs-id4067058){.autogenerated-content}) when the initial velocity
is 13.0 m/s straight up, a result of ${{\pm 3}\text{.}\text{20\ m/s}}{}$
is obtained. Here both signs are meaningful; the positive value occurs
when the rock is at 8.10 m and heading up, and the negative value occurs
when the rock is at 8.10 m and heading back down. It has the same
*speed* but the opposite direction.

![(a) A person throws a rock straight up, as explored in
[link](#fs-id4067058){.autogenerated-content}. The arrows are velocity
vectors at 0, 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 s. (b) A person throws a rock
straight down from a cliff with the same initial speed as before, as in
[link](#fs-id2186600){.autogenerated-content}. Note that at the same
distance below the point of release, the rock has the same velocity in
both cases.](images/Figure_02_06_00b.jpg){#import-auto-id4173440}

Another way to look at it is this: In
[link](#fs-id4067058){.autogenerated-content}, the rock is thrown up
with an initial velocity of ${\text{13}\text{.0\ m/s}}{}$. It rises and
then falls back down. When its position is $y = 0$ on its way back down,
its velocity is ${{- \text{13}}\text{.0\ m/s}}{}$. That is, it has the
same speed on its way down as on its way up. We would then expect its
velocity at a position of ${{y = {- 5}}\text{.}\text{10\ m}}{}$ to be
the same whether we have thrown it upwards at
${+ \text{13}}\text{.0\ m/s}$ or thrown it downwards at
${- \text{13}}\text{.0\ m/s}$. The velocity of the rock on its way down
from $y = 0$ is the same whether we have thrown it up or down to start
with, as long as the speed with which it was initially thrown is the
same.

Find *g* from Data on a Falling Object
:::

The acceleration due to gravity on Earth differs slightly from place to
place, depending on topography (e.g., whether you are on a hill or in a
valley) and subsurface geology (whether there is dense rock like iron
ore as opposed to light rock like salt beneath you.) The precise
acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from data taken in an
introductory physics laboratory course. An object, usually a metal ball
for which air resistance is negligible, is dropped and the time it takes
to fall a known distance is measured. See, for example,
[link](#import-auto-id4097254){.autogenerated-content}. Very precise
results can be produced with this method if sufficient care is taken in
measuring the distance fallen and the elapsed time.

![Positions and velocities of a metal ball released from rest when air
resistance is negligible. Velocity is seen to increase linearly with
time while displacement increases with time squared. Acceleration is a
constant and is equal to gravitational
acceleration.](images/Figure_02_06_02.jpg){#import-auto-id4097254}

Suppose the ball falls 1.0000 m in 0.45173 s. Assuming the ball is not
affected by air resistance, what is the precise acceleration due to
gravity at this location?

We need to solve for acceleration $a{}$. Note that in this case,
displacement is downward and therefore negative, as is acceleration.

1\. Identify the knowns. $y_{0} = 0$; $y = –1\text{.0000\ m}$;

$${{{a = \frac{2{( - 1}\text{.}\text{0000\ m\ –\ 0})}{(0\text{.}\text{45173\ s})^{2}}} = {- 9}}\text{.}\text{8010\ m/s}^{2},}{}$$

The negative value for $a{}$ indicates that the gravitational
acceleration is downward, as expected. We expect the value to be
somewhere around the average value of ${9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$,
so ${9\text{.}\text{8010\ m/s}^{2}}{}$ makes sense. Since the data going
into the calculation are relatively precise, this value for $g{}$ is
more precise than the average value of
${9\text{.}\text{80\ m/s}^{2}}{}$; it represents the local value for the
acceleration due to gravity.

Applying the Science Practices: Finding Acceleration Due to Gravity
:::

While it is well established that the acceleration due to gravity is
quite nearly 9.8 m/s^2^ at all locations on Earth, you can verify this
for yourself with some basic materials.

Your task is to find the acceleration due to gravity at your location.
Achieving an acceleration of precisely 9.8 m/s^2^ will be difficult.
However, with good preparation and attention to detail, you should be
able to get close. Before you begin working, consider the following
questions.

*What measurements will you need to take in order to find the
acceleration due to gravity?*

*What relationships and equations found in this chapter may be useful in
calculating the acceleration?*

*What variables will you need to hold constant?*

*What materials will you use to record your measurements?*

Upon completing these four questions, record your procedure. Once
recorded, you may carry out the experiment. If you find that your
experiment cannot be carried out, you may revise your procedure.

Once you have found your experimental acceleration, compare it to the
assumed value of 9.8 m/s^2^. If error exists, what were the likely
sources of this error? How could you change your procedure in order to
improve the accuracy of your findings?

Suppose you throw a rock nearly straight up at a coconut in a palm tree,
and the rock misses on the way up but hits the coconut on the way down.
Neglecting air resistance, how does the speed of the rock when it hits
the coconut on the way down compare with what it would have been if it
had hit the coconut on the way up? Is it more likely to dislodge the
coconut on the way up or down? Explain.

If an object is thrown straight up and air resistance is negligible,
then its speed when it returns to the starting point is the same as when
it was released. If air resistance were not negligible, how would its
speed upon return compare with its initial speed? How would the maximum
height to which it rises be affected?

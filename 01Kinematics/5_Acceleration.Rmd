In everyday conversation, to accelerate means to speed up. The
accelerator in a car can in fact cause it to speed up. The greater the
[acceleration]{#import-auto-id1298945 data-type="term"}, the greater the
change in velocity over a given time. The formal definition of
acceleration is consistent with these notions, but more inclusive.

Average Acceleration
:::

[Average Acceleration]{#import-auto-id2580108 data-type="term"} is *the
rate at which velocity changes*,

::: {#import-auto-id4040806 data-type="equation"}
$${{{\overset{-}{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}} = \frac{v_{f}{- v_{0}}}{t_{f} - t_{0}}},}{}$$
:::

where *$\overset{-}{a}{}$* is average acceleration, *$v{}$* is velocity,
and *$t{}$* is time. (The bar over the $a{}$ means *average*
acceleration.)
:::

Because acceleration is velocity in m/s divided by time in s, the SI
units for acceleration are $\text{m/s}^{2}{}$, meters per second squared
or meters per second per second, which literally means by how many
meters per second the velocity changes every second.

Recall that velocity is a vector---it has both magnitude and direction.
This means that a change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or
speed), but it can also be a change in *direction*. For example, if a
car turns a corner at constant speed, it is accelerating because its
direction is changing. The quicker you turn, the greater the
acceleration. So there is an acceleration when velocity changes either
in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed) or in direction, or
both.

::: {#fs-id3524141 .note data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label=""}
::: {data-type="title"}
Acceleration as a Vector
:::

Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the *change* in
velocity, ${\Delta v}{}$. Since velocity is a vector, it can change
either in magnitude or in direction. Acceleration is therefore a change
in either speed or direction, or both.
:::

Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the
*change* in velocity, it is not always in the direction of *motion*.
When an object\'s acceleration is in the same direction of its motion,
the object will speed up. However, when an object\'s acceleration is
opposite to the direction of its motion, the object will slow down.
Speeding up and slowing down should not be confused with a positive and
negative acceleration. The next two examples should help to make this
distinction clear.

Making Connections: Car Motion
:::

![Above are arrows representing the motion of five cars (A--E). In all
five cases, the positive direction should be considered to the right of
the page.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_01.jpg){#import-auto-id3579626}

Consider the acceleration and velocity of each car in terms of its
direction of travel.

![Car A is speeding up.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_02.jpg){#fs-id2218162}

Because the positive direction is considered to the right of the paper,
Car A is moving with a positive velocity. Because it is speeding up
while moving with a positive velocity, its acceleration is also
considered positive.

![Car B is slowing down.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_03.jpg){#fs-id3242689}

Because the positive direction is considered to the right of the paper,
Car B is also moving with a positive velocity. However, because it is
slowing down while moving with a positive velocity, its acceleration is
considered negative. (This can be viewed in a mathematical manner as
well. If the car was originally moving with a velocity of +25 m/s, it is
finishing with a speed less than that, like +5 m/s. Because the change
in velocity is negative, the acceleration will be as well.)

![Car C has a constant
speed.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_04.jpg){#fs-id2186010}

Because the positive direction is considered to the right of the paper,
Car C is moving with a positive velocity. Because all arrows are of the
same length, this car is not changing its speed. As a result, its change
in velocity is zero, and its acceleration must be zero as well.

![Car D is speeding up in the opposite direction of Cars A, B,
C.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_05.jpg){#fs-id2672786}

Because the car is moving opposite to the positive direction, Car D is
moving with a negative velocity. Because it is speeding up while moving
in a negative direction, its acceleration is negative as well.

![Car E is slowing down in the same direction as Car D and opposite of
Cars A, B, C.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_06.jpg){#fs-id1956758}

Because it is moving opposite to the positive direction, Car E is moving
with a negative velocity as well. However, because it is slowing down
while moving in a negative direction, its acceleration is actually
positive. As in example B, this may be more easily understood in a
mathematical sense. The car is originally moving with a large negative
velocity (−25 m/s) but slows to a final velocity that is less negative
(−5 m/s). This change in velocity, from −25 m/s to −5 m/s, is actually a
positive change (
$v_{f} - v_{i} = \operatorname{} - 5\text{~m/s~} - - 25\text{~m/s}$ of
20 m/s. Because the change in velocity is positive, the acceleration
must also be positive.

Making Connection - Illustrative Example
:::

The three graphs below are labeled A, B, and C. Each one represents the
position of a moving object plotted against time.

![Three position and time graphs: A, B, and
C.](images/CNX_APPhysics_02_M4_graphoverv.jpg){#fs-id2024196}

As we did in the previous example, let\'s consider the acceleration and
velocity of each object in terms of its direction of travel.

![Graph A of Position (y axis) vs. Time (x
axis).](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_08.jpg){#fs-id2217910}

Object A is continually increasing its position in the positive
direction. As a result, its velocity is considered positive.

![Breakdown of Graph A into two separate
sections.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_09.jpg){#fs-id1850704}

During the first portion of time (shaded grey) the position of the
object does not change much, resulting in a small positive velocity.
During a later portion of time (shaded green) the position of the object
changes more, resulting in a larger positive velocity. Because this
positive velocity is increasing over time, the acceleration of the
object is considered positive.

![Graph B of Position (y axis) vs. Time (x
axis).](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_10.jpg){#fs-id3207940}

As in case A, Object B is continually increasing its position in the
positive direction. As a result, its velocity is considered positive.

![Breakdown of Graph B into two separate
sections.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_11.jpg){#fs-id3195153}

During the first portion of time (shaded grey) the position of the
object changes a large amount, resulting in a large positive velocity.
During a later portion of time (shaded green) the position of the object
does not change as much, resulting in a smaller positive velocity.
Because this positive velocity is decreasing over time, the acceleration
of the object is considered negative.

![Graph C of Position (y axis) vs. Time (x
axis).](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_12.jpg){#fs-id2059002}

Object C is continually decreasing its position in the positive
direction. As a result, its velocity is considered negative.

![Breakdown of Graph C into two separate
sections.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_13.jpg){#fs-id2387653}

During the first portion of time (shaded grey) the position of the
object does not change a large amount, resulting in a small negative
velocity. During a later portion of time (shaded green) the position of
the object changes a much larger amount, resulting in a larger negative
velocity. Because the velocity of the object is becoming more negative
during the time period, the change in velocity is negative. As a result,
the object experiences a negative acceleration.

Calculating Acceleration: A Racehorse Leaves the Gate
:::

A racehorse coming out of the gate accelerates from rest to a velocity
of 15.0 m/s due west in 1.80 s. What is its average acceleration?

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

First we draw a sketch and assign a coordinate system to the problem.
This is a simple problem, but it always helps to visualize it. Notice
that we assign east as positive and west as negative. Thus, in this
case, we have negative velocity.

![](images/Figure_02_03_01a.jpg){#import-auto-id1464243}

We can solve this problem by identifying ${\Delta v}{}$ and
${\Delta t}{}$ from the given information and then calculating the
average acceleration directly from the equation
${{\overset{-}{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}} = \frac{v_{f}{- v_{0}}}{t_{f} - t_{0}}}{}$.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

1\. Identify the knowns. ${v_{0} = 0}{}$,
${v_{f} = {- \text{15}}}\text{.0\ m/s}$ (the minus sign indicates
direction toward the west), ${{\Delta t = 1}\text{.80\ s}}{}$.

2\. Find the change in velocity. Since the horse is going from zero to
${- \text{15.0\ m/s}}{}$, its change in velocity equals its final
velocity: ${{{\Delta v = v_{f}} = {- \text{15}}}\text{.0\ m/s}}{}$.

3\. Plug in the known values (${\Delta v}{}$ and $\Delta t$) and solve
for the unknown $\overset{-}{a}{}$.

::: {#import-auto-id2400983 data-type="equation"}
$${{{{{\overset{-}{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}} = \,\frac{{- \text{15}}\text{.0\ m/s}}{1\text{.80\ s}}} = {- 8}}\text{.33\ m}\text{/s}^{2}}.}{}$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

The minus sign for acceleration indicates that acceleration is toward
the west. An acceleration of ${8\text{.33\ m}\text{/s}^{2}}{}$ due west
means that the horse increases its velocity by 8.33 m/s due west each
second, that is, 8.33 meters per second per second, which we write as
${8\text{.33\ m}\text{/s}^{2}}{}$. This is truly an average
acceleration, because the ride is not smooth. We shall see later that an
acceleration of this magnitude would require the rider to hang on with a
force nearly equal to his weight.

### Instantaneous Acceleration {#instantaneous-acceleration data-type="title"}

[Instantaneous acceleration]{#import-auto-id2303194 data-type="term"}
$a{}$, or the *acceleration at a specific instant in time*, is obtained
by the same process as discussed for instantaneous velocity in [Time,
Velocity, and Speed](/m54771)---that is, by considering an
infinitesimally small interval of time. How do we find instantaneous
acceleration using only algebra? The answer is that we choose an average
acceleration that is representative of the motion.
[link](#import-auto-id2590846){.autogenerated-content} shows graphs of
instantaneous acceleration versus time for two very different motions.
In [link](#import-auto-id2590846){.autogenerated-content}(a), the
acceleration varies slightly and the average over the entire interval is
nearly the same as the instantaneous acceleration at any time. In this
case, we should treat this motion as if it had a constant acceleration
equal to the average (in this case about
${1\text{.}8\ m\text{/s}^{2}}{}$). In
[link](#import-auto-id2590846){.autogenerated-content}(b), the
acceleration varies drastically over time. In such situations it is best
to consider smaller time intervals and choose an average acceleration
for each. For example, we could consider motion over the time intervals
from 0 to 1.0 s and from 1.0 to 3.0 s as separate motions with
accelerations of ${+ 3}\text{.}0\ m\text{/s}^{2}$ and
$\text{–2}\text{.}0\ m\text{/s}^{2}$, respectively.

![Graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two different
one-dimensional motions. (a) Here acceleration varies only slightly and
is always in the same direction, since it is positive. The average over
the interval is nearly the same as the acceleration at any given time.
(b) Here the acceleration varies greatly, perhaps representing a package
on a post office conveyor belt that is accelerated forward and backward
as it bumps along. It is necessary to consider small time intervals
(such as from 0 to 1.0 s) with constant or nearly constant acceleration
in such a
situation.](images/Figure_02_03_02.jpg){#import-auto-id2590846}

+2.0 km. (b) The train moves to the left from ${x\prime}_{0}$ to

${{- 1}\text{.5\ km}}{}$. (Note that the prime symbol (′) is used simply
to distinguish between displacement in the two different situations. The
distances of travel and the size of the cars are on different scales to
fit everything into the

Calculating Displacement: A Subway Train

What are the magnitude and sign of displacements for the motions of the
subway train shown in parts (a) and (b) of

A drawing with a coordinate system is already provided, so we don\'t
need to make a sketch, but we should analyze it to make sure we
understand what it is showing. Pay particular attention to the
coordinate system. To find displacement, we use the equation
${\Delta x = {x_{f} - x_{0}}}{}$. This is straightforward since the
initial and final positions are given.

1\. Identify the knowns. In the figure we see that
${x_{f} =}\text{6.70\ km}$ and ${x_{0} =}\text{4.70\ km}$ for part (a),
and ${{x\prime}_{f} = 3}\text{.75\ km}$ and
${{x\prime}_{0} = 5}\text{.25\ km}$ for part (b).

2\. Solve for displacement in part (a).

To answer this question, think about the definitions of distance and
distance traveled, and how they are related to displacement. Distance
between two positions is defined to be the magnitude of displacement,
which was found in [link](#fs-id1744930){.autogenerated-content}.
Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between the
two positions. (See [Displacement](/m54769).) In the case of the subway
train shown in [link](#import-auto-id2590556){.autogenerated-content},
the distance traveled is the same as the distance between the initial
and final positions of the train.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

1\. The displacement for part (a) was +2.00 km. Therefore, the distance
between the initial and final positions was 2.00 km, and the distance
traveled was 2.00 km.

2\. The displacement for part (b) was $\text{−1.5\ km.}$ Therefore, the
distance between the initial and final positions was 1.50 km, and the
distance traveled was 1.50 km.

It is worth it at this point to make a simple sketch:

![](images/Figure_02_03_03c.jpg){#import-auto-id2400753}

This problem involves three steps. First we must determine the change in
velocity, then we must determine the change in time, and finally we use
these values to calculate the acceleration.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

1\. Identify the knowns. ${v_{0} = 0}{}$ (the trains starts at rest),
${{v_{f} = \text{30}}\text{.}\text{0\ km/h}}{}$, and
${{\Delta t = \text{20}}\text{.}\text{0\ s}}{}$.

2\. Calculate ${\Delta v}{}$. Since the train starts from rest, its
change in velocity is $\Delta v\text{=}\ \text{+}\text{30.0\ km/h}$,
where the plus sign means velocity to the right.

3\. Plug in known values and solve for the unknown, $\overset{-}{a}{}$.

$${{\overset{-}{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}} = \frac{+ \text{30.0\ km/h}}{\text{20}\text{.}0\ s}}{}$$
:::

4\. Since the units are mixed (we have both hours and seconds for time),
we need to convert everything into SI units of meters and seconds. (See
[Physical Quantities and Units](/m54765) for more guidance.)

::: {#import-auto-id2297812 data-type="equation"}
$${{\overset{-}{a} = \left( \frac{+ \text{30\ km/h}}{\text{20.0\ s}} \right)}\left( \frac{\text{10}^{3}\ \text{m}}{\text{1\ km}} \right){\left( \frac{\text{1\ h}}{\text{3600\ s}} \right) = 0}\text{.}\text{417\ m/s}^{2}}{}$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}

The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is
reasonable because the train starts from rest and ends up with a
velocity to the right (also positive). So acceleration is in the same
direction as the *change* in velocity, as is always the case.

The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This sign is
reasonable because the train initially has a positive velocity in this
problem, and a negative acceleration would oppose the motion. Again,
acceleration is in the same direction as the *change* in velocity, which
is negative here. This acceleration can be called a deceleration because
it has a direction opposite to the velocity.

Calculating Deceleration: The Subway Train
:::

Finally, suppose the train in
[link](#import-auto-id2412190){.autogenerated-content} slows to a stop
from a velocity of 20.0 km/h in 10.0 s. What is its average
acceleration?

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

Once again, let\'s draw a sketch:

![](images/Figure_02_03_04b.jpg){#import-auto-id2412073}

As before, we must find the change in velocity and the change in time to
calculate average acceleration.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

1\. Identify the knowns. $v_{0} = {- \text{20\ km/h}}$,
$v_{f} = 0\ km/h$, ${{\Delta t = \text{10}}\text{.}0\ s}{}$.

2\. Calculate ${\Delta v}{}$. The change in velocity here is actually
positive, since

::: {#import-auto-id2581122 data-type="equation"}
$${{{{\Delta v = {v_{f} - v_{0}}} = {0 - \left( {- \text{20\ km/h}} \right)}}\text{=}\text{+}\text{20\ km/h}}.}{}$$
:::

3\. Solve for $\overset{-}{a}{}$.

::: {#import-auto-id2585925 data-type="equation"}
$${\overset{-}{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}} = \frac{{+ \text{20}}\text{.0\ km/h}}{\text{10}\text{.}0\ s}$$
:::

4\. Convert units.

::: {#import-auto-id2581171 data-type="equation"}
$${\overset{-}{a} = \left( \frac{{+ \text{20}}\text{.}\text{0\ km/h}}{\text{10}\text{.}\text{0\ s}} \right)}\left( \frac{\text{10}^{3}\ m}{1\ km} \right)\left( \frac{1\ h}{\text{3600\ s}} \right)\text{=}\ \text{+}0\text{.556\ m}\text{/s}^{2}$$

[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is
reasonable because the train initially has a negative velocity (to the
left) in this problem and a positive acceleration opposes the motion
(and so it is to the right). Again, acceleration is in the same
direction as the *change* in velocity, which is positive here. As in
[link](#fs-id3600466){.autogenerated-content}, this acceleration can be
called a deceleration since it is in the direction opposite to the
velocity.

### Sign and Direction {#sign-and-direction data-type="title"}

Perhaps the most important thing to note about these examples is the
signs of the answers. In our chosen coordinate system, plus means the
quantity is to the right and minus means it is to the left. This is easy
to imagine for displacement and velocity. But it is a little less
obvious for acceleration. Most people interpret negative acceleration as
the slowing of an object. This was not the case in
[link](#fs-id4015260){.autogenerated-content}, where a positive
acceleration slowed a negative velocity. The crucial distinction was
that the acceleration was in the opposite direction from the velocity.
In fact, a negative acceleration will *increase* a negative velocity.
For example, the train moving to the left in
[link](#import-auto-id2412190){.autogenerated-content} is sped up by an
acceleration to the left. In that case, both $v{}$ and $a{}$ are
negative. The plus and minus signs give the directions of the
accelerations. If acceleration has the same sign as the velocity, the
object is speeding up. If acceleration has the opposite sign as the
velocity, the object is slowing down.

An airplane lands on a runway traveling east. Describe its acceleration.
:::

::: {#fs-id4071605 data-type="solution"}
If we take east to be positive, then the airplane has negative
acceleration, as it is accelerating toward the west. It is also
decelerating: its acceleration is opposite in direction to its velocity.

![Graph showing Velocity vs. Time of a
cart.](images/Figure_Ch2_M4_14.jpg){#fs-id3184333}

A cart is constrained to move along a straight line. A varying net force
along the direction of motion is exerted on the cart. The cart\'s
velocity *v* as a function of time *t* is shown in the graph. The five
labeled points divide the graph into four sections.

Which of the following correctly ranks the magnitude of the average
acceleration of the cart during the four sections of the graph?

a.  *a~CD~* \> *a~AB~* \> *a~BC~* \> *a~DE~*

sloped line whose slope steadily decreases to zero. The *y*-intercept of
the graph may be any value. The line on the velocity vs. time graph
should have a positive *y*-intercept and a negative slope. Because the
final velocity of the book is zero, the line should finish on the
*x*-axis.

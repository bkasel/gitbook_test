### Position {#position data-type="title"}

In order to describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to
describe its [position]{data-type="term"}---where it is at any
particular time. More precisely, you need to specify its position
relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a
reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it
relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a
rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket
with respect to the Earth as a whole, while a professor\'s position
could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby
white board. (See
[link](#import-auto-id2972079){.autogenerated-content}.) In other cases,
we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion
relative to the Earth. To describe the position of a person in an
airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not the Earth, as the
reference frame. (See
[link](#import-auto-id2707699){.autogenerated-content}.)

### Displacement {#displacement-1 data-type="title"}

If an object moves relative to a reference frame (for example, if a
professor moves to the right relative to a white board or a passenger
moves toward the rear of an airplane), then the object\'s position
changes. This change in position is known as
[displacement]{data-type="term"}. The word "displacement" implies that
an object has moved, or has been displaced.

::: {#fs-id3206000 .note data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label=""}
::: {data-type="title"}
Displacement
:::

Displacement is the *change in position* of an object:

::: {#eip-458 data-type="equation"}
$${\text{Δ}x = {x_{\text{f}} - x_{0}},}{}$$
:::

where ${\text{Δ}x}{}$ is displacement, $x_{\text{f}}{}$ is the final
position, and *`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*$x_{0}{}$ is the initial
position.
:::

In this text the upper case Greek letter $\text{Δ}{}$ (delta) always
means "change in" whatever quantity follows it; thus, ${\text{Δ}x}{}$
means *change in position*. Always solve for displacement by subtracting
initial position $x_{0}{}$ from final position $x_{\text{f}}{}$.

Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter (m) (see [Physical
Quantities and Units](/m54765)), but sometimes kilometers, miles, feet,
and other units of length are used. Keep in mind that when units other
than the meter are used in a problem, you may need to convert them into
meters to complete the calculation.

![A professor paces left and right while lecturing. Her position
relative to the blackboard is given by $x{}$. The
${{+ 2}\text{.}0\ \text{m}}{}$ displacement of the professor relative to
the blackboard is represented by an arrow pointing to the
right.](images/Figure_02_01_01.jpg){#import-auto-id2972079}

![A passenger moves from his seat to the back of the plane. His location
relative to the airplane is given by $x{}$. The −4 m displacement of the
passenger relative to the plane is represented by an arrow toward the
rear of the plane. Notice that the arrow representing his displacement
is twice as long as the arrow representing the displacement of the
professor (he moves twice as far) in
[link](#import-auto-id2972079){.autogenerated-content}.](images/Figure%2002_01_02.jpg){#import-auto-id2707699}

Note that displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude. The
professor\'s displacement is 2.0 m to the right, and the airline
passenger\'s displacement is 4.0 m toward the rear. In one-dimensional
motion, direction can be specified with a plus or minus sign. When you
begin a problem, you should select which direction is positive (usually
that will be to the right or up, but you are free to select positive as
being any direction). The professor\'s initial position is
${{x_{0} = 1}\text{.}5\ \text{m}}{}$ and her final position is
${{x_{\text{f}} = 3}\text{.}5\ \text{m}}{}$. Thus her displacement is

::: {#eip-556 data-type="equation"}
$${{{\Delta x = x_{f}{- x_{0}} = 3}\text{.5\ m} - 1.5\ m = + 2\text{.0\ m}}.}{}$$
:::

In this coordinate system, motion to the right is positive, whereas
motion to the left is negative. Similarly, the airplane passenger\'s
initial position is ${x_{0} = 6}\text{.}0\ m$ and his final position is
${{x_{f} = 2}\text{.}0\ m}{}$, so his displacement is

::: {#eip-778 data-type="equation"}
$${{\Delta x = x_{f}{- x_{0}} = 2}\text{.}0\ m - 6\text{.}0\ m = {- 4}\text{.}0\ m}.$$
:::

His displacement is negative because his motion is toward the rear of
the plane, or in the negative $x{}$ direction in our coordinate system.

### Distance {#distance data-type="title"}

Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is
not. [Distance]{data-type="term"} is defined to be *the magnitude or
size of displacement between two positions*. Note that the distance
between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between
them. [Distance traveled]{data-type="term"} is *the total length of the
path traveled between two positions*. Distance has no direction and,
thus, no sign. For example, the distance the professor walks is 2.0 m.
The distance the airplane passenger walks is 4.0 m.

::: {#fs-id3044492 .note data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label=""}
::: {data-type="title"}
Misconception Alert: Distance Traveled vs. Magnitude of Displacement
:::

It is important to note that the *distance traveled*,
*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*however, can be greater than the
magnitude of the displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of
the displacement without regard to its direction; that is, just a number
with a unit). For example, the professor could pace back and forth many
times, perhaps walking a distance of 150 m during a lecture, yet still
end up only 2.0 m to the right of her starting point. In this case her
displacement would be +2.0 m, the magnitude of her displacement would be
2.0 m, but the distance she traveled would be 150 m. In kinematics we
nearly always deal with displacement and magnitude of displacement, and
almost never with distance traveled. One way to think about this is to
assume you marked the start of the motion and the end of the motion. The
displacement is simply the difference in the position of the two marks
and is independent of the path taken in traveling between the two marks.
The distance traveled, however, is the total length of the path taken
between the two marks.

A cyclist rides 3 km west and then turns around and rides 2 km east. (a)
What is her displacement? (b) What distance does she ride? (c) What is
the magnitude of her displacement?
:::

::: {#fs-id1711333 data-type="solution"}
![](images/Figure_02_01_03.jpg){#import-auto-id2776946}

\(a\) The rider\'s displacement is
${{\Delta x = {x_{f} - x_{0}}} = \text{−1\ km}}{}$. (The displacement is
negative because we take east to be positive and west to be negative.)

\(b\) The distance traveled is
${{\text{3\ km} + \text{2\ km}} = \text{5\ km}}{}$.

\(c\) The magnitude of the displacement is $1\ km{}$.

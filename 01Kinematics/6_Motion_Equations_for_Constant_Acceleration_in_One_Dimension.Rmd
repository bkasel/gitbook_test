### Learning Objectives { data-type="title"}

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Calculate displacement of an object that is not accelerating, given
    initial position and velocity.
-   Calculate final velocity of an accelerating object, given initial
    velocity, acceleration, and time.
-   Calculate displacement and final position of an accelerating object,
    given initial position, initial velocity, time, and acceleration.

The information presented in this section supports the following APÂ®
learning objectives and science practices:

-   **3.A.1.1** The student is able to express the motion of an object
    using narrative, mathematical, or graphical representations. **(S.P.
    1.5, 2.1, 2.2)**
-   **3.A.1.3** The student is able to analyze experimental data
    describing the motion of an object and is able to express the
    results of the analysis using narrative, mathematical, and graphical
    representations. **(S.P. 5.1)**
:::

We might know that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving
away from a stop sign, the greater the displacement in a given time. But
we have not developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and
displacement. In this section, we develop some convenient equations for
kinematic relationships, starting from the definitions of displacement,
velocity, and acceleration already covered.

### Notation: *t*, *x*, *v*, *a* {#notation-t-x-v-a data-type="title"}

First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial
time to be zero, as if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great
simplification. Since elapsed time is ${\Delta t = {t_{f} - t_{0}}}{}$,
taking ${t_{0} = 0}{}$ means that ${\Delta t = t_{f}}{}$, the final time
on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the
subscript 0 to denote initial values of position and velocity. That is,
$x_{0}$ *is the initial position* and $v_{0}{}$ *is the initial
velocity*. We put no subscripts on the final values. That is, $t$ *is
the final time*, $x{}$ *is the final position*, and $v$ *is the final
velocity*. This gives a simpler expression for elapsed time---now,
${\Delta t = t}{}$. It also simplifies the expression for displacement,
which is now $\Delta x = {x - x_{0}}$. Also, it simplifies the
expression for change in velocity, which is now
${\Delta v = {v - v_{0}}}{}$. To summarize, using the simplified
notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,

::: {#import-auto-id2563693 data-type="equation"}
$$\left. \begin{array}{lll}
{\Delta t} & = & t \\
{\Delta x} & = & {x - x_{0}} \\
{\Delta v} & = & {v - v_{0}} \\
\end{array} \right\}$$
:::

where *the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a
subscript denotes a final value* in whatever motion is under
consideration.

We now make the important assumption that *acceleration is constant*.
This assumption allows us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous
acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and
instantaneous accelerations are equal. That is,

::: {#import-auto-id1819116 data-type="equation"}
$${{{\overset{-}{a} = a} = \text{constant}},}{}$$
:::

so we use the symbol $a{}$ for acceleration at all times. Assuming
acceleration to be constant does not seriously limit the situations we
can study nor degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing,
acceleration *is* constant in a great number of situations. Furthermore,
in many other situations we can accurately describe motion by assuming a
constant acceleration equal to the average acceleration for that motion.
Finally, in motions where acceleration changes drastically, such as a
car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, the motion can
be considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant
acceleration.

Solving for Displacement ($\Delta x$) and Final Position ($x{}$) from
Average Velocity when Acceleration ($a{}$) is Constant
:::

To get our first two new equations, we start with the definition of
average velocity:

::: {#import-auto-id1782525 data-type="equation"}
$${{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

Substituting the simplified notation for $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$
yields

::: {#import-auto-id4145482 data-type="equation"}
$${{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{x - x_{0}}{t}}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

Solving for $x{}$ yields

::: {#import-auto-id2297251 data-type="equation"}
$${{x = {x_{0} + \overset{-}{v}}}t\text{,}}{}$$
:::

where the average velocity is

::: {#import-auto-id2086556 data-type="equation"}
$${{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2}}\ (\text{constant}\ a)\text{.}}{}$$
:::
:::

The equation ${\overset{-}{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2}}{}$ reflects the
fact that, when acceleration is constant, $v{}$ is just the simple
average of the initial and final velocities. For example, if you
steadily increase your velocity (that is, with constant acceleration)
from 30 to 60 km/h, then your average velocity during this steady
increase is 45 km/h. Using the equation
${\overset{-}{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2}}{}$ to check this, we see that

::: {#import-auto-id4152098 data-type="equation"}
$${{{\overset{-}{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v}{2}} = \frac{\text{30\ km/h} + \text{60\ km/h}}{2}} = \text{45\ km/h,}}{}$$

Velocity and final displacement are both positive, which means they are
in the same direction.
:::

The equation ${{x = {x_{0} + \overset{-}{v}}}t}{}$ gives insight into
the relationship between displacement, average velocity, and time. It
shows, for example, that displacement is a linear function of average
velocity. (By linear function, we mean that displacement depends on
*$\overset{-}{v}{}$* rather than on *$\overset{-}{v}{}$* raised to some
other power, such as *${\overset{-}{v}}^{2}{}$*. When graphed, linear
functions look like straight lines with a constant slope.) On a car
trip, for example, we will get twice as far in a given time if we
average 90 km/h than if we average 45 km/h.

:::

The final velocity is much less than the initial velocity, as desired
when slowing down, but still positive. With jet engines, reverse thrust
could be maintained long enough to stop the plane and start moving it
backward. That would be indicated by a negative final velocity, which is
not the case here.

![The airplane lands with an initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and slows to a
final velocity of 10.0 m/s before heading for the terminal. Note that
the acceleration is negative because its direction is opposite to its
velocity, which is
positive.](images/Figure_02_04_01.jpg){#import-auto-id2173965}
:::

In addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation
${v = {v_{0} + \text{at}}}{}$ gives us insight into the relationships
among velocity, acceleration, and time. From it we can see, for example,
that

-   [final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and how
    long it lasts]{#import-auto-id2180047}
-   [if the acceleration is zero, then the final velocity equals the
    initial velocity ${({v = v_{0}})}{}$, as expected (i.e., velocity is
    constant)]{#import-auto-id2180050}
-   [if *$a{}$* is negative, then the final velocity is less than the
    initial velocity]{#import-auto-id2175665}

(All of these observations fit our intuition, and it is always useful to
examine basic equations in light of our intuition and experiences to
check that they do indeed describe nature accurately.)

An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has a larger average
acceleration than the Space Shuttle and achieves a greater velocity in
the first minute or two of flight (actual ICBM burn times are
classified---short-burn-time missiles are more difficult for an enemy to
destroy). But the Space Shuttle obtains a greater final velocity, so
that it can orbit the earth rather than come directly back down as an
ICBM does. The Space Shuttle does this by accelerating for a longer
time.

We can combine the equations above to find a third equation that allows

Adding $v_{0}{}$ to each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives

$${{\frac{v_{0} + v}{2} = {v_{0} + \frac{1}{2}}}\text{at}\text{.}}{}$$

In order to determine which equations are best to use, we need to list
all of the known values and identify exactly what we need to solve for.
We shall do this explicitly in the next several examples, using tables
to set them off.

${{a = {- 7}}\text{.}\text{00}\ \text{m/s}^{2}}{}$ ($a$ is negative
because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We take $x_{0}{}$ to
be 0. We are looking for displacement ${\Delta x}{}$, or
${x - x_{0}}{}$.

2\. Identify the equation that will help up solve the problem. The best
equation to use is

This equation is best because it includes only one unknown, $x{}$. We
know the values of all the other variables in this equation. (There are
other equations that would allow us to solve for $x{}$, but they require
us to know the stopping time, $t{}$, which we do not know. We could use
them but it would entail additional calculations.)

3\. Rearrange the equation to solve for $x{}$.

$$x - x_{0} = \frac{v^{2} - v_{0}^{2}}{2a}$$

Once the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in
Parts A and B for dry and wet concrete. So to answer this question, we
need to calculate how far the car travels during the reaction time, and
then add that to the stopping time. It is reasonable to assume that the
velocity remains constant during the driver\'s reaction time.

1\. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that
$\overset{-}{v} = \text{30.0\ m/s}$;
$t_{\text{reaction}} = 0.500\,\text{s}$; $a_{\text{reaction}} = 0$. We
take $x_{0 - \text{reaction}}$ to be 0. We are looking for
$x_{\text{reaction}}{}$.

2\. Identify the best equation to use.

${{x = {x_{0} + \overset{-}{v}}}t}{}$ works well because the only
unknown value is $x{}$, which is what we want to solve for.

3\. Plug in the knowns to solve the equation.

::: {#import-auto-id2175306 data-type="equation"}
$${{{x = {0 + \left( {\text{30}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}} \right)}}{\left( {0\text{.}\text{500\ s}} \right) = \text{15}}\text{.}\text{0\ m}}.}{}$$
:::

This means the car travels 15.0 m while the driver reacts, making the
total displacements in the two cases of dry and wet concrete 15.0 m
greater than if he reacted instantly.

4\. Add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement
when braking.

![The distance necessary to stop a car varies greatly, depending on road
conditions and driver reaction time. Shown here are the braking
distances for dry and wet pavement, as calculated in this example, for a

The displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a
fast-moving car. It should take longer to stop a car on wet rather than
dry pavement. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to
the displacements. But more important is the general approach to solving
problems. We identify the knowns and the quantities to be determined and
then find an appropriate equation. There is often more than one way to
solve a problem. The various parts of this example can in fact be solved
by other methods, but the solutions presented above are the shortest.

Calculating Time: A Car Merges into Traffic

We are asked to solve for the time $t{}$. As before, we identify the
known quantities in order to choose a convenient physical relationship
(that is, an equation with one unknown, $t{}$).

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

1\. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that
${v_{0} = \text{10\ m/s}}{}$; ${{a = 2}\text{.}\text{00\ m/s}^{2}}{}$;
and ${x = \text{200\ m}}{}$.

2\. We need to solve for $t{}$. Choose the best equation.
${{x = {x_{0} + v_{0}}}{t + \frac{1}{2}}\text{at}^{2}}{}$ works best
because the only unknown in the equation is the variable $t{}$ for which
we need to solve.

3\. We will need to rearrange the equation to solve for $t{}$. In this
case, it will be easier to plug in the knowns first.

::: {#import-auto-id2179013 data-type="equation"}
$${{\text{200\ m} = {\text{0\ m} + \left( {\text{10}\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}} \right)}}{t + \frac{1}{2}}\left( {2\text{.}\text{00\ m/s}^{2}} \right)\, t^{2}}{}$$
:::

4\. Simplify the equation. The units of meters (m) cancel because they
are in each term. We can get the units of seconds (s) to cancel by
taking ${{t = t}\ \text{s}}{}$, where $t{}$ is the magnitude of time and
s is the unit. Doing so leaves

::: {#eip-635 data-type="equation"}
$${{{\text{200} = \text{10}}{t + t^{2}}}\text{.}}{}$$
:::

5\. Use the quadratic formula to solve for $t{}$*.*

\(a\) Rearrange the equation to get 0 on one side of the equation.

::: {#import-auto-id1680208 data-type="equation"}
$${{t^{2} + \text{10}}{{t - \text{200}} = 0}}{}$$
:::

This is a quadratic equation of the form

::: {#import-auto-id1680214 data-type="equation"}
$${{{{\text{at}^{2} + \text{bt}} + c} = 0},}{}$$
:::

where the constants are
${{a = 1}\text{.}\text{00,}\ {b = \text{10}}\text{.}\text{0,}\ \text{and}\ {c = {- \text{200}}}}{}$.

\(b\) Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula:

::: {#import-auto-id2367246 data-type="equation"}
$${t = \frac{{- b} \pm \sqrt{{b^{2} - 4}\text{ac}}}{2a}}\text{.}$$
:::

This yields two solutions for $t{}$, which are

::: {#import-auto-id1772100 data-type="equation"}
$${{{t = \text{10}}\text{.}0\ \text{and}{- \text{20}}\text{.}0}.}{}$$
:::

In this case, then, the time is
${t = t}{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}*
in*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* seconds, or

::: {#import-auto-id2175275 data-type="equation"}
$${{{t = \text{10}}\text{.}0\ \text{s}\ {\text{and} - \text{20}}\text{.}0\ \text{s}}.}{}$$
:::

A negative value for time is unreasonable, since it would mean that the
event happened 20 s before the motion began. We can discard that
solution. Thus,

::: {#import-auto-id2177316 data-type="equation"}
$${{{t = \text{10}}\text{.}0\ \text{s}}.}{}$$

Whenever an equation contains an unknown squared, there will be two
solutions. In some problems both solutions are meaningful, but in
others, such as the above, only one solution is reasonable. The 10.0 s
answer seems reasonable for a typical freeway on-ramp.

Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment---Breaking News
:::

We have been using SI units of meters per second squared to describe
some examples of acceleration or deceleration of cars, runners, and
trains. To achieve a better feel for these numbers, one can measure the
braking deceleration of a car doing a slow (and safe) stop. Recall that,
for average acceleration, ${\overset{-}{a} = {\Delta v/\Delta t}}{}$.
While traveling in a car, slowly apply the brakes as you come up to a
stop sign. Have a passenger note the initial speed in miles per hour and
the time taken (in seconds) to stop. From this, calculate the
deceleration in miles per hour per second. Convert this to meters per
second squared and compare with other decelerations mentioned in this
chapter. Calculate the distance traveled in braking.

acceleration would be greater at the beginning or end of the run and
what effect that would have on the final velocity.

\(a\) ${\text{32}\text{.}\text{6\ m/s}^{2}}{}$

\(b\) $\text{162\ m/s}{}$

\(c\) ${v > v_{\text{max}}}{}$, because the assumption of constant
acceleration is not valid for a dragster. A dragster changes gears, and
would have a greater acceleration in first gear than second gear than
third gear, etc. The acceleration would be greatest at the beginning, so
it would not be accelerating at ${\text{32}\text{.}\text{6\ m/s}^{2}}{}$
during the last few meters, but substantially less, and the final
velocity would be less than 162 m/s.

A bicycle racer sprints at the end of a race to clinch a victory. The
racer has an initial velocity of 11.5 m/s and accelerates at the rate of
${0\text{.}\text{500\ m/s}^{2}}{}$ for 7.00 s. (a) What is his final
velocity? (b) The racer continues at this velocity to the finish line.
If he was 300 m from the finish line when he started to accelerate, how
much time did he save? (c) One other racer was 5.00 m ahead when the
winner started to accelerate, but he was unable to accelerate, and
traveled at 11.8 m/s until the finish line. How far ahead of him (in
meters and in seconds) did the winner finish?

In 1967, New Zealander Burt Munro set the world record for an Indian
motorcycle, on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, with a maximum speed
of 183.58 mi/h. The one-way course was 5.00 mi long. Acceleration rates
are often described by the time it takes to reach 60.0 mi/h from rest.
If this time was 4.00 s, and Burt accelerated at this rate until he
reached his maximum speed, how long did it take Burt to complete the
course?

\(a\) A world record was set for the men\'s 100-m dash in the 2008
Olympic Games in Beijing by Usain Bolt of Jamaica. Bolt "coasted" across
the finish line with a time of 9.69 s. If we assume that Bolt
accelerated for 3.00 s to reach his maximum speed, and maintained that
speed for the rest of the race, calculate his maximum speed and his
acceleration. (b) During the same Olympics, Bolt also set the world
record in the 200-m dash with a time of 19.30 s. Using the same
assumptions as for the 100-m dash, what was his maximum speed for this
race?

A group of students is attempting to determine the average acceleration
of a marble released from the top of a long ramp. Below is a set of data
representing the marble\'s position with respect to time.

  Position (cm)   Time (s)
  --------------- ----------
  0.0             0.0
  0.3             0.5
  1.25            1.0
  2.8             1.5
  5.0             2.0
  7.75            2.5
  11.3            3.0

Use the data table above to construct a graph determining the
acceleration of the marble. Select a set of data points from the table
and plot those points on the graph. Fill in the blank column in the
table for any quantities you graph other than the given data. Label the
axes and indicate the scale for each. Draw a best-fit line or curve
through your data points.

Using the best-fit line, determine the value of the marble\'s
acceleration.

A graph, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. Graphs not only
contain numerical information; they also reveal relationships between
physical quantities. This section uses graphs of position, velocity, and
acceleration versus time to illustrate one-dimensional kinematics.

### Slopes and General Relationships {#slopes-and-general-relationships data-type="title"}

First note that graphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one
horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical quantities are
plotted against one another in such a graph, the horizontal axis is
usually considered to be an [independent
variable]{#import-auto-id1690042 data-type="term"} and the vertical axis
a [dependent variable]{#import-auto-id2013112 data-type="term"}. If we
call the horizontal axis the $x{}$-axis and the vertical axis the
$y{}$-axis, as in
[link](#import-auto-id2359358){.autogenerated-content}, a straight-line
graph has the general form

::: {#import-auto-id4175150 data-type="equation"}
$${{{y = {\text{mx} +}}b}.}{}$$
:::

Here $m{}$ is the [slope]{#import-auto-id1773074 data-type="term"},
defined to be the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the
straight line. The letter $b{}$ is used for the
[*y*-intercept]{#import-auto-id2955215 data-type="term"}, which is the
point at which the line crosses the vertical axis.

### Graph of Position vs. Time (*a* = 0, so *v* is constant) {#graph-of-position-vs.-time-a-0-so-v-is-constant data-type="title"}

Time is usually an independent variable that other quantities, such as
position, depend upon. A graph of position versus time would, thus, have
$x{}$ on the vertical axis and $t{}$ on the horizontal axis.
[link](#import-auto-id2574769){.autogenerated-content} is just such a
straight-line graph. It shows a graph of position versus time for a
jet-powered car on a very flat dry lake bed in Nevada.

![Graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on the Bonneville
Salt Flats.](images/Figure_02_07_02.jpg){#import-auto-id2574769}

Using the relationship between dependent and independent variables, we
see that the slope in the graph above is average velocity
$\overset{-}{v}{}$ and the intercept is position at time zero---that is,
$x_{0}{}$. Substituting these symbols into ${y = {\text{mx} + b}}{}$
gives

::: {#import-auto-id4019047 data-type="equation"}
$${{x = \overset{-}{v}}{t + x_{0}}}{}$$
:::

or

::: {#import-auto-id2357165 data-type="equation"}
$${{{x = {x_{0} + \overset{-}{v}}}t}.}{}$$
:::

Thus a graph of position versus time gives a general relationship among
position, velocity, and time, as well as giving detailed numerical
information about a specific situation.

::: {#fs-id4125096 .note data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label=""}
::: {data-type="title"}
The Slope of *x* vs. *t*
:::

The slope of the graph of position $x{}$ vs. time
$t{}$*`<!-- no-selfclose -->`{=html}* is velocity $v{}$.

::: {#import-auto-id4121188 data-type="equation"}
$$\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = v$$
:::

Notice that this equation is the same as that derived algebraically from
other motion equations in [Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in
One Dimension](/m54773).
:::

From the figure we can see that the car has a position of 400 m at time
0.650 m at $t{}$ = 1.0 s, and so on. Its position at times other than
those listed in the table can be read from the graph; furthermore,
information about its velocity and acceleration can also be obtained
from the graph.

:::

The slope of a graph of $x{}$ vs. $t{}$ is average velocity, since slope
equals rise over run. In this case, rise = change in position and run =
change in time, so that

::: {#import-auto-id1850584 data-type="equation"}
$${\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \overset{-}{v}}.$$
:::

Since the slope is constant here, any two points on the graph can be
used to find the slope. (Generally speaking, it is most accurate to use
two widely separated points on the straight line. This is because any
error in reading data from the graph is proportionally smaller if the
interval is larger.)

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

1\. Choose two points on the line. In this case, we choose the points
labeled on the graph: (6.4 s, 2000 m) and (0.50 s, 525 m). (Note,
however, that you could choose any two points.)

2\. Substitute the $x$ and $t$ values of the chosen points into the
equation. Remember in calculating change ${(\Delta)}{}$ we always use
final value minus initial value.

::: {#import-auto-id4181834 data-type="equation"}

This is an impressively large land speed (900 km/h, or about 560 mi/h):
much greater than the typical highway speed limit of 60 mi/h (27 m/s or

### Graphs of Motion when $a{}$ is constant but ${a \neq 0}{}$ {#graphs-of-motion-when-a-is-constant-but-a-neq-0 data-type="title"}

The graphs in [link](#import-auto-id3596921){.autogenerated-content}
below represent the motion of the jet-powered car as it accelerates
toward its top speed, but only during the time when its acceleration is
constant. Time starts at zero for this motion (as if measured with a
stopwatch), and the position and velocity are initially 200 m and 15
m/s, respectively.

![Graphs of motion of a jet-powered car during the time span when its
acceleration is constant. (a) The slope of an $x{}$ vs. $t{}$ graph is
velocity. This is shown at two points, and the instantaneous velocities
obtained are plotted in the next graph. Instantaneous velocity at any
point is the slope of the tangent at that point. (b) The slope of the
$v{}$ vs. $t{}$ graph is constant for this part of the motion,
indicating constant acceleration. (c) Acceleration has the constant
value of ${5\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}^{2}}{}$ over the time interval
plotted.](images/Figure_02_07_03.jpg){#import-auto-id3596921}

![A U.S. Air Force jet car speeds down a track. (credit: Matt Trostle,
Flickr)](images/Figure_02_07_03a.jpg){#import-auto-id3583460}

The graph of position versus time in
[link](#import-auto-id3596921){.autogenerated-content}(a) is a curve
rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve becomes steeper as
time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The
slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous
velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line tangent
to the curve at the point of interest and taking the slope of this
straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points in
[link](#import-auto-id3596921){.autogenerated-content}(a). If this is
done at every point on the curve and the values are plotted against
time, then the graph of velocity versus time shown in
[link](#import-auto-id3596921){.autogenerated-content}(b) is obtained.
Furthermore, the slope of the graph of velocity versus time is
acceleration, which is shown in
[link](#import-auto-id3596921){.autogenerated-content}(c).

Determining Instantaneous Velocity from the Slope at a Point: Jet Car
:::

Calculate the velocity of the jet car at a time of 25 s by finding the
slope of the $x{}$ vs. $t{}$ graph in the graph below.

![The slope of an $x{}$ vs. $t{}$ graph is velocity. This is shown at

::: {.tinysection}
[Strategy]{data-type="title"}
:::

The slope of a curve at a point is equal to the slope of a straight line
tangent to the curve at that point. This principle is illustrated in
[link](#import-auto-id4141386){.autogenerated-content}, where Q is the
point at ${t = \text{25\ s}}{}$.

::: {.tinysection}
[Solution]{data-type="title"}
:::

1\. Find the tangent line to the curve at ${t = \text{25\ s}}{}$.

2\. Determine the endpoints of the tangent. These correspond to a
position of 1300 m at time 19 s and a position of 3120 m at time 32 s.

3\. Plug these endpoints into the equation to solve for the slope,
*$v{}$*.

::: {#import-auto-id3627758 data-type="equation"}
$${{\text{slope} = v_{Q}} = \frac{{\Delta x}_{Q}}{{\Delta t}_{Q}}} = \frac{\left( {\text{3120\ m} - \text{1300\ m}} \right)}{\left( {\text{32\ s} - \text{19\ s}} \right)}$$
:::

Thus,

::: {#import-auto-id1657105 data-type="equation"}
$${v_{Q} = \frac{\text{1820\ m}}{\text{13\ s}}} = \text{140\ m/s.}$$
:::

::: {.tinysection}
[Discussion]{data-type="title"}
:::

This is the value given in this figure\'s table for $v{}$ at
$t = \text{25\ s}$. The value of 140 m/s for $v_{Q}$ is plotted in
[link](#import-auto-id4141386){.autogenerated-content}. The entire graph
of $v{}$ vs. $t$ can be obtained in this fashion.
:::

Carrying this one step further, we note that the slope of a velocity
versus time graph is acceleration. Slope is rise divided by run; on a
$v{}$ vs. $t$ graph, rise = change in velocity ${\Delta v}{}$ and run =
change in time ${\Delta t}{}$.

::: {#fs-id1405001 .note data-type="note" has-label="true" data-label=""}
::: {data-type="title"}
The Slope of *v* vs. *t*
:::

The slope of a graph of velocity $v{}$ vs. time $t{}$ is acceleration
$a{}$.

::: {#import-auto-id4096826 data-type="equation"}
$$\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = a$$
:::
:::

Since the velocity versus time graph in
[link](#import-auto-id3596921){.autogenerated-content}(b) is a straight
line, its slope is the same everywhere, implying that acceleration is
constant. Acceleration versus time is graphed in
[link](#import-auto-id3596921){.autogenerated-content}(c).

Additional general information can be obtained from
[link](#import-auto-id4141386){.autogenerated-content} and the
expression for a straight line, ${y = {\text{mx} + b}}{}$.

In this case, the vertical axis $y{}$ is $V{}$, the intercept $b{}$ is
$v_{0}{}$, the slope $m{}$ is $a{}$, and the horizontal axis $x{}$ is
$t{}$. Substituting these symbols yields

::: {#import-auto-id1714581 data-type="equation"}
$${v = {v_{0} + \text{at}}.}{}$$
:::

A general relationship for velocity, acceleration, and time has again
been obtained from a graph. Notice that this equation was also derived
algebraically from other motion equations in [Motion Equations for
Constant Acceleration in One Dimension](/m54773).

It is not accidental that the same equations are obtained by graphical
analysis as by algebraic techniques. In fact, an important way to
*discover* physical relationships is to measure various physical
quantities and then make graphs of one quantity against another to see
if they are correlated in any way. Correlations imply physical
relationships and might be shown by smooth graphs such as those above.
From such graphs, mathematical relationships can sometimes be
postulated. Further experiments are then performed to determine the
validity of the hypothesized relationships.

### Graphs of Motion Where Acceleration is Not Constant {#graphs-of-motion-where-acceleration-is-not-constant data-type="title"}

Now consider the motion of the jet car as it goes from 165 m/s to its
top velocity of 250 m/s, graphed in
[link](#import-auto-id1534076){.autogenerated-content}. Time again
starts at zero, and the initial position and velocity are 2900 m and 165
m/s, respectively. (These were the final position and velocity of the
car in the motion graphed in
[link](#import-auto-id3596921){.autogenerated-content}.) Acceleration
gradually decreases from $5\text{.}\text{0\ m/s}^{2}$ to zero when the
car hits 250 m/s. The slope of the $x{}$ vs. $t{}$ graph increases until
${t = \text{55\ s}}{}$, after which time the slope is constant.
Similarly, velocity increases until 55 s and then becomes constant,
since acceleration decreases to zero at 55 s and remains zero afterward.

A graph of position versus time can be used to generate a graph of
velocity versus time, and a graph of velocity versus time can be used to
generate a graph of acceleration versus time. We do this by finding the
slope of the graphs at every point. If the graph is linear (i.e., a line
with a constant slope), it is easy to find the slope at any point and
you have the slope for every point. Graphical analysis of motion can be
used to describe both specific and general characteristics of
kinematics. Graphs can also be used for other topics in physics. An
important aspect of exploring physical relationships is to graph them
and look for underlying relationships.
